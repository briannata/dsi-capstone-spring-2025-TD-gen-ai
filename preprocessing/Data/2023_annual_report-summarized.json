In times of significant change, our customers and clients turn to us to help them navigate complexity and achieve their financial goals.” 2TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 OUR STRATEGY A diversified business delivers for our stakeholders In 2023, TD demonstrated the benefits of its diversified business model. Our ability to adapt and execute with speed and purpose allowed the Bank to drive progress and deliver for our stakeholders. We grew our customer base and invested in new capabilities to make us even stronger and more competitive. We introduced leading customer-facing applications and enhanced execution excellence with new technology and agile work models. We remained focused on those we serve, extended our lead as Canada’s largest digital bank, and surpassed 10 million customers at TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank. We also closed a strategic transaction and welcomed 1,700 TD Cowen colleagues to TD Securities. Across the Bank, our businesses are well-positioned to continue to serve our nearly 28 million customers and clients by delivering ease, value, and trusted advice. Amid an increasingly challenging environment, the Bank reported fiscal 2023 earnings of $10.8 billion ($15.1 billion on an adjusted basis). While this was down 38 per cent compared to 2022 (two per cent on an adjusted basis) reflecting the decline in macroeconomic conditions and further credit normalization, our capital position remained strong. We ended the year with a Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio of 14.4 per cent, well above regulatory requirements. Our performance and financial strength enabled TD to return value directly to shareholders. We paid a higher dividend in 2023 and initiated the repurchase of up to 90 million common shares, after completing our previously announced repurchase of 30 million shares. Our confidence in the earnings power of our franchise enabled us to declare a dividend increase of six per cent effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Supporting customers through change It would be an understatement to call 2023 a period of change. We saw inflation climb, and central banks rapidly raise interest rates in response. Households and businesses faced new challenges. Economies, though somewhat resilient, began to slow. Technology, including generative AI, disrupted at scale. Industries continued to transform to meet new demands and needs. We continued to adapt to help our customers navigate these fundamental changes to the environment. At TD, we believe that banking serves a higher purpose. In times of significant change, our customers and clients turn to us to help them navigate complexity and achieve their financial goals. We take this responsibility seriously and work hard to earn the trust of those we serve every day. We are engines of economic progress, providing liquidity and credit to foster growth. We invest in communities, support those impacted by economic uncertainty, and help advance a more sustainable and inclusive future. The Canadian Personal Bank remains Canada’s leading banking franchise, and in 2023 we sharpened our focus to drive growth in key areas critical to future success. Our New-to-Canada program enabled thousands to establish themselves in a new country with access to tailored products and services. Our credit card portfolio delivered industry-leading offers to meet customers’ unique needs, backed by relationships with top brands, including Aeroplan, Uber, Amazon, and Starbucks. In Real Estate Secured Lending, we grew share in a challenging market by offering proactive advice. The Canadian Business Bank combined increased industry specialization with a focus on customer experience to drive growth. Leveraging the reach and scale of Canada’s leading branch network, we deployed business bankers across the country and doubled the number of Senior Private Bankers co-located in our Commercial Banking centres, advancing our OneTD strategies. We added sector specialists, created a technology venture team, expanded our support for women entrepreneurs, and launched the Black Entrepreneur Credit Access Program. We supported small",

In Wealth Management and Insurance, we widened our leadership position and continued to disrupt the market. We remain Canada’s largest institutional asset manager and operate the country’s top-ranked digital brokerage platform. We launched TD Active Trader to offer our customers increased speed and flexibility. TD Insurance, Canada’s number-one direct insurer, continued to reshape the market with innovative digital capabilities and offers, such as small business insurance. TD Insurance colleagues provided advice and assistance to communities devastated by wildfires and flooding. With our growing competitive differentiation and deepening customer connections, TD emerged as Canada’s most valuable brand in 2023. In the United States, TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank, continues to deliver on the promise of its human-centric brand. When the banking crisis hit the U.S. market in the spring, we offered our customers stability and assurance. We continue to be well-positioned across our Maine-to-Florida footprint, investing in new products and services to meet the needs of customers across one of the biggest banking markets in the world. For the seventh consecutive year, we ranked number one in Small Business Administration (SBA) lending in our footprint – and number two in SBA loans nationally. Notwithstanding the progress we have made in our U.S. business, it was disappointing that some shortcomings in our anti-money laundering control environment were identified during the year, which we are working hard to address, and I am confident that in time we will. As announced earlier in the year, given the uncertainty of the approval timeline, we mutually agreed with First Horizon to terminate the previously announced transaction. Although this was a difficult decision – and one not taken lightly – it was the right one for the Bank under the circumstances. In Wholesale, TD Securities continues to advance our long-term growth strategy to build a fully integrated North American dealer with global reach. We significantly expanded the scope of our services and capabilities and are winning new mandates and new clients. With the addition of TD Cowen, we have added deep talent and complementary capabilities that will deliver greater value for clients and accelerate our growth strategy. Strengthened the best team in banking In 2023, we continued to invest in our colleagues to attract, retain and develop the best talent for today and tomorrow. TD’s culture, backed by Shared Commitments that unify the efforts of our diverse workforce offers a significant advantage as we build, serve, and focus on the future. TD was recognized as a Best Workplace in both Canada and the United States by Great Place to Work. The Bank was also named a Top Company for Diversity by DiversityInc., Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, and one of Forbes’ America’s Best Employers for Diversity. Driving sustainable and inclusive growth The Bank’s sustainability priorities are embedded in our business strategy. We bring significant expertise, resources, and financing to clients as they transition to meet heightened market expectations and seize the opportunities of a low carbon economy. Through products, services, and trusted advice, we are helping businesses contribute to a more sustainable future. We also advanced our own efforts. This year, we launched a new Sustainable and Decarbonization Finance Target to support customers, clients, and the communities we serve by mobilizing $500 billion by 2030 through financial activities and the Bank’s own investments. In recognition of our leadership, we were proud to be listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the ninth consecutive year – the only North American-based bank included on this year’s World Index. Through the TD Ready Commitment, we are supporting the future prosperity of the communities in which we live and work, as we invest in programs that create opportunities for people to thrive in a changing world. We are making progress toward our $1 billion 2030 target, with $157 million contributed this year alone in support of community, non-profit, and other organizations. Looking forward with confidence The Bank enters 2024 from a position of strength, with proven resiliency, a powerful brand and a strong capital position. A dynamic economic and operating environment will continue to shift in the year ahead. While an economic downturn has not yet materialized, inflation, rising rates and affordability challenges are already having an impact. TD is well-positioned to pivot, adapt, and deliver as circumstances change. Our businesses are strong, and our customer relationships continue to grow and deepen. We attract and retain the best talent in the industry. Our disciplined financial management will allow us to enhance our performance and serve the evolving needs of our customers and clients. In addition, we will continue to invest in our risk and control environment and strengthen our capabilities, commensurate with a bank of our size and risk profile. I want to thank our more than 95,000 TD bankers around the world for their commitment and dedication, our customers and clients for their trust, and our shareholders for their continued support as we build the Better Bank.

Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements From time to time, the Bank (as defined in this document) makes written and/or oral forward-looking statements, including in this document, in other filings with Canadian regulators or the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in other communications. In addition, representatives of the Bank may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media, and others. All such statements are made pursuant to the “safe harbour” provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“2023 MD&A”) in the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report under the heading “Economic Summary and Outlook”, under the headings “Key Priorities for 2024” and “Operating Environment and Outlook” for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading “2023 Accomplishments and Focus for 2024” for the Corporate segment, and in other statements regarding the Bank’s objectives and priorities for 2024 and beyond and strategies to achieve them, the regulatory environment in which the Bank operates, and the Bank’s anticipated financial performance. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “will”, “would”, “should”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”, “plan”, “goal”, “target”, “may”, and “could”. By their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond the Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, and infrastructure), model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors include general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates; geopolitical risk; inflation, rising rates and recession; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; the ability of the Bank to execute on long-term strategies, shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions and integration of acquisitions, the ability of the Bank to achieve its financial or strategic objectives with respect to its investments, business retention plans, and other strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks, data security breaches or technology failures) on the Bank’s technologies, systems and networks, those of the Bank’s customers (including their own devices), and third parties providing services to the Bank; model risk; fraud activity; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the Bank’s use of third parties; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws, rules and regulations, including without limitation tax laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; environmental and social risk (including climate change); exposure related to significant litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes to the Bank’s credit ratings; changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices; the interconnectivity of Financial Institutions including existing and potential international debt crises; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition risk; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Bank; the economic, financial, and other impacts of pandemics; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events. The Bank cautions that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Bank’s results. For more detailed information, please refer to the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2023 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as applicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the heading “Significant and Subsequent Events” in the relevant MD&A, which applicable releases may be found on www.td.com. All such factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, should be considered carefully when making decisions with respect to the Bank.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS a) Restructuring Charges The Bank undertook certain measures in the fourth quarter of 2023 to reduce its cost base and achieve greater efficiency. In connection with these measures, the Bank incurred $363 million of restructuring charges which primarily relate to employee severance and other personnel-related costs, real estate optimization, and asset impairments. The Bank expects to incur additional restructuring charges of a similar magnitude in the first half of calendar 2024. b) Acquisition of Cowen Inc. On March 1, 2023, the Bank completed the acquisition of Cowen Inc. (“Cowen”). The acquisition advances the Wholesale Banking segment’s long-term growth strategy in the U.S. and adds complementary products and services to the Bank’s existing businesses. The results of the acquired business have been consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and primarily reported in the Wholesale Banking segment. Consideration included $1,500 million (US$1,100 million) in cash for 100% of Cowen’s common shares outstanding, $253 million (US$186 million) for the settlement of Cowen’s Series A Preferred Stock, and $205 million (US$151 million) related to the replacement of share-based payment awards. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method. The purchase price allocation can be adjusted during the measurement period, which shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances. The acquisition contributed $10,800 million (US$7,933 million) of assets and $9,884 million (US$7,261 million) of liabilities. The excess of accounting consideration over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired is allocated to other intangible assets of $298 million (US$219 million) net of taxes, and goodwill of $744 million (US$546 million). c) Termination of the Merger Agr eement with First Horizon Corporation On May 4, 2023, the Bank and First Horizon Corporation (“First Horizon” or “FHN”) announced their mutual decision to terminate the previously announced merger agreement for the Bank to acquire First Horizon. Under the terms of the termination agreement, the Bank made a $306 million (US$225 million) cash payment to First Horizon on May 5, 2023. The termination payment was recognized in non-interest expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and was reported in the Corporate segment. In connection with the transaction, the Bank had invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Bank recognized a valuation adjustment loss of $199 million (US$147 million) on this investment, recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). On June 26, 2023, in accordance with the terms of the preferred share purchase agreement, the preferred stock converted into approximately 19.7 million common shares of First Horizon, resulting in the Bank recognizing a loss of $166 million (US$126 million) during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 in OCI based on First Horizon’s common share price at the time of conversion. The Bank had also implemented a strategy to mitigate the impact of interest rate volatility to capital on closing of the acquisition. The Bank determined that the fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets would have been sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets would have determined the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles would have negatively impacted capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships. As a result of the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps were recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) would have mitigated the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments. Prior to the termination of the merger agreement on May 4, 2023, for the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank reported ($1,386) million in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $262 million in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank reported $585 million in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps. Following the announcement to terminate the merger agreement, the Bank discontinued this strategy and reinstated hedge accounting on the portfolio of fixed income investments using new swaps entered into at higher market rates. Income recognized from this strategy will reverse over time causing a decrease to net interest income. For the year ended October 31, 2023, the decrease to net interest income was ($127) million, recorded in the Corporate segment. The Bank had also implemented a strategy to mitigate FX risk on the expected USD cash consideration. Following the announcement to terminate the merger agreement, the Bank discontinued this strategy. Given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar during the life of the strategy, the Bank was in a net gain position on the date of hedge termination and cumulative net gains were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). d) Implementation of the Canada Recovery Dividend and Change in Corporate Tax Rate On December 15, 2022, Bill C-32, Fall Economic Statement Implementation Act, 2022, received Royal Assent. This bill enacted the Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD) and increased the Canadian federal tax rate for bank and life insurer groups by 1.5%. The implementation of the CRD resulted in a provision for income taxes of $553 million and a charge to OCI of $239 million, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the Canadian federal tax rate of 1.5%, prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, resulted in a provision for income taxes of $82 million and a tax benefit of $75 million in OCI related to fiscal 2022, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank also remeasured certain Canadian deferred tax assets and liabilities for the increase in tax rate, which resulted in an increase in net deferred tax assets of $50 million, which is recorded in provision for income taxes. e) Stanford Litigation Settlement In the US Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. action, on February 24, 2023, the Bank reached a settlement in principle (the “settlement” or “agreement”) relating to litigation involving the Stanford Financial Group (the “Stanford litigation”), pursuant to which the Bank agreed to pay US$1.205 billion to the court-appointed receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate. Under the terms of the agreement, TD has settled with the receiver, the Official Stanford Investors Committee, and other plaintiffs in the litigation and these parties have agreed to release and dismiss all current or future claims arising from or related to the Stanford matter. As a result of this agreement, the Bank recorded a provision of approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax ($1.2 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank recognized a foreign exchange loss of $39 million ($28 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting the impact of the difference between the foreign exchange rate used for recording the provision (effective January 31, 2023) and the foreign exchange rate at the time the settlement was reached. f) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment On November 16, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced a final rule that implements a special assessment to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors during the U.S. bank failures in Spring 2023 (the “Special Assessment”). The Special Assessment is expected to result in the recognition of a provision of approximately US$300 million pre-tax in the first quarter of the Bank’s fiscal 2024. 20",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key financial activities and impacts:\n\n1. **Restructuring Charges**: In Q4 2023, TD Bank incurred $363 million in restructuring charges related to employee severance, real estate optimization, and asset impairments, with similar charges expected in early 2024.\n\n2. **Acquisition of Cowen Inc.**: The acquisition, completed on March 1, 2023, for $1.5 billion, enhances TD's Wholesale Banking segment in the U.S. The acquisition added $10.8 billion in assets and $9.9 billion in liabilities, with $298 million allocated to intangible assets and $744 million to goodwill.\n\n3. **Termination of First Horizon Merger**: The merger with First Horizon was mutually terminated on May 4, 2023, resulting in a $306 million termination payment and a $199 million valuation loss on preferred stock. The bank also recognized losses related to interest rate swaps and FX risk mitigation strategies.\n\n4. **Canada Recovery Dividend and Tax Rate Change**: The implementation of the Canada Recovery Dividend and a 1.5% increase in the Canadian federal tax rate led to a $553 million tax provision and a $239 million charge to OCI in Q1 2023.\n\n5. **Stanford Litigation Settlement**: TD Bank settled litigation related to the Stanford Financial Group for US$1.205 billion, resulting in a $1.6 billion pre-tax provision in Q1 2023.\n\n6. **FDIC Special Assessment**: A special assessment by the FDIC, announced in November 2023, is expected to result in a US$300 million pre-tax provision in fiscal 2024 due to U.S. bank failures in Spring 2023."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”). TD is the sixth largest bank in North America by assets and serves more than 27.5 million customers in four key businesses operating in a number of locations in financial centres around the globe: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, including TD Canada Trust and TD Auto Finance Canada; U.S. Retail, including TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank®, TD Auto Finance U.S., TD Wealth (U.S.), and an investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation; Wealth Management and Insurance, including TD Wealth (Canada), TD Direct Investing, and TD Insurance; and Wholesale Banking, including TD Securities and TD Cowen. TD also ranks among the world’s leading online financial services firms, with more than 16 million active online and mobile customers. TD had $1.96 trillion in assets on October 31, 2023. The Toronto-Dominion Bank trades under the symbol “TD” on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges. The global economy remains on track to slow in calendar 2023 and 2024, but to a lesser extent than anticipated in the previous quarter. Inflation has generally continued to cool across the G-7, and more central banks have taken a pause on interest rate hikes. Central bankers will remain vigilant on inflation and further rate hikes cannot be ruled out, but most are fine-tuning interest rate adjustments at this stage. The lagged impact of cumulative interest rate hikes is expected to be the primary influence dampening economic growth and returning inflation closer to the target ranges of the various regions by the end of calendar 2024. The U.S. economy expanded by 4.9% annualized in the third calendar quarter of 2023. Underlying domestic demand grew at an impressive 3.5% pace, as consumer spending accelerated from a soft performance in the second calendar quarter. Government spending accelerated, driven by an uptick in federal defence spending. Housing activity also increased for the first time in over two years, reflecting lower mortgage rates earlier in the year. However, business investment weakened, after a stronger-than- expected performance in the first half of calendar 2023. As of October, the U.S. job market was still tight with the unemployment rate still historically low at 3.9%. However, there are signs that demand for workers is cooling, as evidenced by both slower trend growth in payrolls and a slight increase in the unemployment rate over the prior six months. Although the downturn in total inflation has stalled in recent months due to higher energy costs, core inflation measures have continued to move lower. Underlying services prices continue to be a source of persistent price pressure. Given that inflation remains well above the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 2% target, the central bank remains highly attentive to upside risks. TD Economics continues to believe there is a chance the federal funds rate may rise a further quarter point from its current range of 5.25-5.50% early in calendar 2024. The economic environment remains fluid. If the central bank sees evidence of further cooling in the labor market and is increasingly confident that inflation is headed towards its 2% target, it could opt to hold rates steady. Given the steep rise in interest rates over the past year, the trend towards tighter U.S. credit and financial conditions, and the likelihood of rolling periods of financial stress related to risk factors, the probability of a recession stateside remains elevated. The Canadian economy has been affected by numerous temporary economic events, which have contributed to weakness in the economic activity data. Real GDP was nearly unchanged in the second calendar quarter of 2023, reflecting softer consumer spending and ongoing weakness in housing activity. Business investment was one bright spot, as investment in engineering structures and transportation equipment increased. Despite signs of slowing in the Canadian economy, progress on inflation has stalled in recent months. The trend rate of job growth has slowed below that of the labour force, pushing the unemployment rate higher. TD Economics expects the unemployment rate to continue to move higher in the months ahead, contributing to prolonged weakness in consumer spending. Given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of substantial interest rate hikes on highly indebted Canadian households, the risk of recession also remains elevated in Canada. The Bank of Canada has left the overnight interest rate unchanged at 5.00% since July. However, it has expressed concern about the persistence of underlying inflation. TD Economics does not expect further interest rate hikes, but the incoming economic data will determine whether more will be required in Canada to bring inflation down to the 2% target. The Canadian dollar is expected to hover in the 72 to 74 U.S. cent range over the next few quarters. The Bank prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS, the current GAAP , and refers to results prepared in accordance with IFRS as “reported” results. Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures In addition to reported results, the Bank also presents certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures that are historical, non- GAAP ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures, to assess its results. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as “adjusted” results, are utilized to assess the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note”, from reported results. Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP ratios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the Bank’s performance. Non- GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. Supplementary financial measures depict the Bank’s financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the Bank’s capital position, and both are explained in this document where they first appear. U.S. Strategic Cards The Bank’s U.S. strategic cards portfolio is comprised of agreements with certain U.S. retailers pursuant to which TD is the U.S. issuer of private label and co-branded consumer credit cards to their U.S. customers. Under the terms of the individual agreements, the Bank and the retailers share in the profits generated by the relevant portfolios after credit losses. Under IFRS, TD is required to present the gross amount of revenue and provisions for credit losses (PCL) related to these portfolios in the Bank’s Consolidated Statement of Income. At the segment level, the retailer program partners’ share of revenues and credit losses is presented in the Corporate segment, with an offsetting amount (representing the partners’ net share) recorded in Non-interest expenses, resulting in no impact to Corporate’s reported Net income (loss). The Net income (loss) included in the U.S. Retail segment includes only the portion of revenue and credit losses attributable to TD under the agreements. Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation and IDA Agreement On October 6, 2020, the Bank acquired an approximately 13.5% stake in The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) following the completion of Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (“TD Ameritrade”) of which the Bank was a major shareholder (the “Schwab transaction”). On August 1, 2022, the Bank sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Schwab, at a price of US$66.53 per share for proceeds of $2.5 billion (US$1.9 billion), which reduced the Bank’s ownership interest in Schwab to approximately 12.0%. The Bank recognized $997 million as other income (net of $368 million loss from AOCI reclassified to earnings), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The U.S. Retail segment reflects the Bank’s share of net income from its investment in Schwab. The Corporate segment net income (loss) includes amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles, the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction, and the Bank’s share of restructuring charges incurred by Schwab.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights its position as the sixth largest bank in North America, serving over 27.5 million customers across various sectors, including Canadian and U.S. retail banking, wealth management, insurance, and wholesale banking. The bank had $1.96 trillion in assets as of October 31, 2023. The report discusses the global economic outlook, noting a slowdown in growth but less severe than previously anticipated, with inflation cooling across the G-7 and central banks pausing interest rate hikes. The U.S. economy showed strong growth in Q3 2023, driven by consumer and government spending, though business investment weakened. The U.S. job market remains tight, but signs of cooling are evident. Inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's target, with potential for further rate hikes. In Canada, economic activity is weak, with stalled inflation progress and rising unemployment, raising recession risks. The Bank of Canada has maintained its interest rate at 5.00%. TD Bank uses non-GAAP financial measures to assess performance, and its U.S. strategic cards portfolio involves partnerships with U.S. retailers. The bank's investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation is accounted for using the equity method, with income reflected in the U.S. Retail segment."

Under the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. Refer to the “Related Party Transactions” section in the 2023 MD&A for further details. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into an amended insured deposit account agreement (the “2023 Schwab IDA Agreement” or the “Schwab IDA Agreement”), which replaced the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement. Pursuant to the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank continues to make sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Schwab designates a portion of the deposits with the Bank as fixed-rate obligation amounts (FROA). Remaining deposits over the minimum level of FROA are designated as floating-rate obligations. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by three years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until September 2025, the aggregate FROA will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to $6.8 billion (US$5 billion) of FROA by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to certain limits. During the year ended October 31, 2023, Schwab exercised its option to buy down $6.1 billion (US$4.5 billion) of FROA and paid $305 million (US$227 million) in termination fees to the Bank in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement. The fees are intended to compensate the Bank for losses incurred this year from discontinuing certain hedging relationships, as well as for lost revenues. The net impact is recorded in net interest income. The following table provides the operating results on a reported basis for the Bank. TABLE 2 OPERATING RESULTS – Reported | (millions of Canadian dollars) 2023 2022 Net interest income $ 29,944 $ 27,353 Non-interest income 20,548 21,679 Total revenue 50,492 49,032 Provision for credit losses 2,933 1,067 Insurance claims and related expenses 3,705 2,900 Non-interest expenses 30,768 24,641 Income before income taxes and share of net income from investment in Schwab 13,086 20,424 Provision for (recovery of) income taxes 3,168 3,986 Share of net income from investment in Schwab 864 991 Net income – reported 10,782 17,429 Preferred dividends and distributions on other equity instruments 563 259 Net income available to common shareholders $ 10,219 $ 17,170 22",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key points regarding its financial relationship with Schwab. The report notes that Schwab's earnings available to common shareholders are reported with a one-month lag. A significant development is the amendment of the insured deposit account agreement with Schwab, originally signed in 2019 and amended in 2023. The new agreement extends the expiration date to July 1, 2034, and adjusts deposit balance requirements, with lower balances in the initial years and higher balances later. Schwab has the option to reduce fixed-rate obligation amounts (FROA) by paying fees, which it exercised in 2023, resulting in a $305 million payment to TD Bank. This payment compensates for losses from discontinued hedging and lost revenues, impacting net interest income. Financially, TD Bank reported a net income of $10.8 billion in 2023, down from $17.4 billion in 2022, with increased provisions for credit losses and insurance claims contributing to the decline."

The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. The consolidated Bank adjusted ROE is calculated as adjusted net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. Adjusted ROE is a non-GAAP ratio, and can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Capital allocated to the business segments increased to 11% of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital effective in the first quarter of 2023, compared with 10.5% in fiscal 2022.

ROTCE is calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a percentage of average TCE. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated using reported net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for all items of note, as a percentage of average TCE. TCE, ROTCE, and adjusted ROTCE can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. TCE is a non-GAAP financial measure, and ROTCE and adjusted ROTCE are non-GAAP ratios. 24 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS TABLE 7 RETURN ON TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY| (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) 2023 2022 Average common equity $ 101,555 $ 95,326 Average goodwill 17,919 16,803 Average imputed goodwill and intangibles on investments in Schwab 6,127 6,515 Average other acquired intangibles1 584 492 Average related deferred tax liabilities (154) (172) Average tangible common equity 77,079 71,688 Net income available to common shareholders – reported 10,219 17,170 Amortization of acquired intangibles, net of income taxes 271 216 Net income available to common shareholders adjusted for amortization of acquired intangibles, net of income taxes 10,490 17,386 Other items of note, net of income taxes 4,090 (2,220) Net income available to common shareholders – adjusted $ 14,580 $ 15,166 Return on tangible common equity 13.6% 24.3% Return on tangible common equity – adjusted 18.9 21.2 1 Excludes intangibles relating to software and asset servicing rights.

The decrease reflects higher non-interest expenses, the impact of the terminated First Horizon acquisition-related capital hedging strategy, and higher PCL, partially offset by higher revenues. On an adjusted basis, net income for the year was $15,143 million, a decrease of $282 million, or 2%, compared with last year. The reported ROE for the year was 10.1%, compared with 18.0% last year. The adjusted ROE for the year was 14.4%, compared with 15.9% last year.

Adjusted net income also decreased slightly by 2% to $15,143 million. The reported return on equity (ROE) dropped to 10.1% from 18.0% the previous year, while the adjusted ROE decreased to 14.4% from 15.9%. Earnings per share (EPS) followed a similar trend, with reported diluted EPS decreasing by 41% to $5.60 and adjusted diluted EPS decreasing by 4% to $7.99. Segment-wise, the Corporate segment saw the largest decline in net income, followed by decreases in Wholesale Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance, and U.S. Retail, partially offset by an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Revenue Reported revenue was $50,492 million, an increase of $1,460 million, or 3%, compared with last year. Adjusted revenue was $51,839 million, an increase of $5,669 million, or 12%, compared with last year. Reported net interest income for the year was $29,944 million, an increase of $2,591 million, or 9%, compared with last year. The increase reflects margin growth in the personal and commercial banking businesses and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by lower net interest income in Wholesale Banking and lower sweep and other deposit volumes in U.S. Retail. Adjusted net interest income was $30,394 million, an increase of $3,087 million, or 11%. By segment, the increase in reported net interest income reflects an increase in U.S. Retail of $2,433 million, an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $1,796 million, and an increase in Wealth Management and Insurance of $111 million, partially offset by a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $1,399 million and a decrease in the Corporate segment of $350 million. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. This metric is an indicator of the profitability of the Bank’s earning assets less the cost of funding. Net interest margin increased by 5 basis points (bps) during the year to 1.74%, compared with 1.69% last year, driven by higher deposit margins reflecting rising interest rates. Average interest earning assets used in the calculation is a non- GAAP financial measure and net interest margin is a non-GAAP ratio. They are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. NON-INTEREST INCOME Reported non-interest income for the year was $20,548 million, a decrease of $1,131 million, or 5%, compared with last year, primarily reflecting the impact of the terminated First Horizon acquisition-related capital hedging strategy and gain in the prior period on sale of Schwab shares. Adjusted non-interest income was $21,445 million, an increase of $2,582 million, or 14%, primarily reflecting higher equity commissions, global transaction banking revenue, advisory fees, and equity underwriting fees in Wholesale Banking, including the acquisition of Cowen Inc., and an increase in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar increase in insurance claims, partially offset by lower fee-based revenue in the personal and commercial banking and wealth businesses. By segment, the decrease in reported non-interest income reflects a decrease in the Corporate segment of $3,345 million, a decrease in U.S. Retail of $416 million, and a decrease in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $65 million, partially offset by an increase in Wholesale Banking of $2,386 million and an increase in Wealth Management and Insurance of $309 million. 3 (millions of Canadian dollars) AdjustedReported 20222023 28,000 $32,000 12,000 0 16,000 24,000 20,000 8,000 4,000 TABLE 9 NON-INTEREST INCOME | (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) 2023 vs. 2022 2023 2022 % change Investment and securities services Broker dealer fees and commissions $ 1,263 $ 1,009 25 Full-service brokerage and other securities services 1,518 1,489 2 Underwriting and advisory 997 558 79 Investment management fees 636 651 (2) Mutual fund management 1,897 2,057 (8) Trust fees 109 105 4 Total investment and securities services 6,420 5,869 9 Credit fees 1,796 1,615 11 Trading income (losses) 2,417 (257) 1,040 Service charges 2,609 2,871 (9) Card services 2,932 2,890 1 Insurance revenue 5,671 5,380 5 Other income (loss) (1,297) 3,311 (139) Total $ 20,548 $ 21,679 (5) 3 For additional information about the Bank’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, refer to “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in the “Financial Results Overview” section of this document. 27",

By segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects an increase in the Corporate segment of $2,607 million, an increase in Wholesale Banking of $1,727 million, an increase in U.S. Retail of $1,271 million, an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $524 million, and a decrease in Wealth Management and Insurance of $2 million. Insurance claims and related expenses were $3,705 million, an increase of $805 million, or 28%, compared with last year, reflecting the impact of changes in the discount rate which resulted in a similar increase in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income, increased claims severity and more severe weather-related events. The efficiency ratio measures operating efficiency and is calculated by dividing non-interest expenses by total revenue. A lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted non-interest expenses and total revenue. The reported efficiency ratio was 60.9%, compared with 50.3% last year. The adjusted efficiency ratio was 52.9%, compared with 52.8% last year.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 annual report highlights a significant increase in non-interest expenses, which rose by $6,127 million (25%) to $30,768 million. This increase is attributed to higher employee-related costs, the acquisition of Cowen Inc., the Stanford litigation settlement, and charges related to the terminated First Horizon acquisition. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses increased by $3,071 million (13%) to $27,430 million. By segment, the Corporate segment saw the largest increase in expenses, followed by Wholesale Banking, U.S. Retail, and Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, while Wealth Management and Insurance saw a slight decrease. Insurance claims and related expenses also rose by 28% due to changes in the discount rate and more severe weather-related events. The reported efficiency ratio, which measures operating efficiency, increased to 60.9% from 50.3% last year, indicating less efficient operations, while the adjusted efficiency ratio remained relatively stable at 52.9%."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Taxes Reported total income and other taxes decreased by $581 million, or 10.1%, compared with last year, reflecting a decrease in income tax expense of $818 million, or 20.5%, partially offset by an increase in other taxes of $237 million, or 13.2%. Adjusted total income and other taxes increased by $343 million from last year, or 6.4%, reflecting an increase in income tax expense of $106 million, or 2.9%, and an increase in other taxes of $237 million, or 13.2%. The Bank’s reported effective income tax rate was 24.2% for 2023, compared with 19.5% last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the implementation of the Canada Recovery Dividend and the 1.5% Canadian federal tax rate increase beginning in 2022, the impact of the terminated First Horizon transaction, and favourable tax impacts in the prior year associated with the sale of Schwab shares, earnings mix and the recognition of unused tax losses. For a reconciliation of the Bank’s effective income tax rate with the Canadian statutory income tax rate, refer to Note 24 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank reported its investment in Schwab using the equity method of accounting. Schwab’s tax expense (2023: $279 million; 2022: $319 million) was not part of the Bank’s effective tax rate. To allow for an after-tax calculation of adjusted income, the adjusted provision for income taxes is calculated by adjusting the taxes for each item of note using the applicable income tax rate of the relevant legal entity. The adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes before other taxes as a percentage of adjusted net income before taxes. The Bank’s adjusted effective income tax rate for 2023 was 20.8%, compared with 20.1% last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the increased tax rate arising from the 2022 Canadian Federal budget as well as the favourable impacts in the prior year associated with earnings mix and the recognition of unused tax losses. Adjusted results are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers.

Budgetary Tax Measures The Canadian Federal budget presented on March 28, 2023 (“the Budget”) proposed to introduce tax measures that could impact the Bank. On June 22, 2023, Bill C-47, Budget Implementation Act, 2023, No. 1, received Royal Assent. This bill enacted one of the proposed tax measures by amending the definition of a “financial service” such that payment card clearing services rendered by a payment card network operator are subject to GST/HST. The legislation was retrospective and resulted in a charge to non-interest income of $57 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2023. On August 4, 2023, draft legislative proposals were released for public comment relating to other Budget measures, including a 2% tax on the net value of share repurchases by public corporations in Canada and draft legislative proposals relating to the implementation of a global minimum tax initiated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Pillar Two). The proposal is that the Pillar Two rules will take effect for fiscal years that begin on or after December 31, 2023, which will be November 1, 2024 for the Bank. On November 21, 2023, the federal government issued its Fall Economic Statement in which it confirmed its intention to proceed with previously announced tax measures, including its proposal to deny the dividend received deduction in respect of dividends received by financial institutions on shares that are mark-to- market property, subject to a minor carve out for dividends on certain preferred shares. On November 28, 2023, the government introduced the Fall Economic Statement Implementation Act, 2023, which includes legislation regarding the dividend received deduction and the 2% tax on share repurchases. The Bank is participating actively in the public comment process regarding tax proposals that may impact the Bank and the broader Canadian economy. 30",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 annual report highlights a decrease in reported total income and other taxes by $581 million (10.1%) compared to the previous year, primarily due to a significant reduction in income tax expense by $818 million (20.5%), partially offset by an increase in other taxes by $237 million (13.2%). The adjusted total income and other taxes, however, increased by $343 million (6.4%), with an adjusted effective income tax rate rising to 20.8% from 20.1% last year. The increase in tax rates is attributed to the Canada Recovery Dividend, a 1.5% Canadian federal tax rate increase, and other factors like the terminated First Horizon transaction. The report also discusses the impact of the Canadian Federal budget's tax measures, including a retrospective GST/HST charge on payment card clearing services and proposed taxes on share repurchases and a global minimum tax. The Bank is actively engaging in public discussions on these tax proposals."

On an adjusted basis, net income for the quarter was $3,505 million, a decrease of $560 million, or 14%. Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.49, a decrease of 59%, compared with $3.62 in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.83, a decrease of 16%, compared with $2.18 in the fourth quarter of last year. Reported revenue for the quarter was $13,121 million, a decrease of $2,442 million, or 16%, compared with the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted revenue for the quarter was $13,185 million, an increase of $938 million, or 8%, compared with the fourth quarter last year. Reported net interest income for the quarter was $7,494 million, a decrease of $136 million, or 2%, compared with the fourth quarter last year, primarily reflecting lower net interest income in Wholesale Banking and lower deposit volumes in U.S. Retail, partially offset by margin growth in the personal and commercial banking businesses. Adjusted net interest income for the quarter was $7,558 million, a decrease of $69 million, or 1%. By segment, the decrease in reported net interest income reflects a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $438 million, a decrease in Wealth Management and Insurance of $11 million, a decrease in the Corporate segment of $2 million, and a decrease in U.S. Retail of $2 million, partially offset by an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $317 million. Reported non-interest income for the quarter was $5,627 million, a decrease of $2,306 million, or 29%, compared with the fourth quarter last year, primarily reflecting the gain from the impact of the terminated First Horizon acquisition-related capital hedging strategy and gain on sale of Schwab shares in the prior period. Adjusted non-interest income was $5,627 million, an increase of $1,007 million, or 22%, reflecting higher equity commissions, underwriting fees, and advisory fees in Wholesale Banking, including the acquisition of Cowen Inc., and higher revenue in insurance. By segment, the decrease in reported non-interest income reflects a decrease in the Corporate segment of $3,265 million, a decrease in U.S. Retail of $35 million, and a decrease in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $17 million, partially offset by an increase in Wholesale Banking of $767 million and an increase in Wealth Management and Insurance of $244 million. PCL for the quarter was $878 million, an increase of $261 million compared with the fourth quarter last year. PCL – impaired was $719 million, an increase of $265 million, or 58%, reflecting some normalization of credit performance. PCL – performing was $159 million, a decrease of $4 million. The performing provisions this quarter were largely recorded in the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking and Wholesale Banking segments, reflecting current credit conditions and volume growth. Total PCL for the quarter as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.39%. By segment, PCL was higher by $161 million in Canadian Personal & Commercial Banking, by $64 million in U.S. Retail, by $31 million in Wholesale Banking, and by $5 million in the Corporate segment. Insurance claims and related expenses were $1,002 million, an increase of $279 million, or 39%, compared with the fourth quarter last year, reflecting increased claims severity, more severe weather-related events, and the impact of changes in the discount rate which resulted in a similar increase in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income. Reported non-interest expenses for the quarter were $7,883 million, an increase of $1,338 million, or 20%, compared with the fourth quarter last year reflecting higher employee-related expenses, including the acquisition of Cowen Inc., restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration- related charges related to the Cowen acquisition. Adjusted non-interest expenses for the quarter were $7,243 million, an increase of $813 million, or 13%, compared with the fourth quarter last year. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects an increase in Wholesale Banking of $639 million, an increase in the Corporate segment of $508 million, an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $118 million, and an increase in U.S. Retail of $90 million, partially offset by a decrease in Wealth Management and Insurance of $17 million. The Bank’s reported effective tax rate was 18.7% for the quarter, compared with 16.9% in the same quarter last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the increased tax rate arising from the 2022 Canadian Federal budget as well as the favourable tax impacts in the same quarter last year associated with the sale of Schwab shares, earnings mix and the recognition of unused tax losses. The Bank’s adjusted effective tax rate was 19.5% for the quarter, compared with 16.7% in the same quarter last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the increased tax rate arising from the 2022 Canadian Federal budget as well as the favourable tax impacts in the same quarter last year associated with earnings mix and the recognition of unused tax losses. Subject to the impact of seasonal trends and items of note, the Bank’s reported earnings were down 2% in 2023, reflecting a challenging macroeconomic environment. As the year progressed, the Bank’s personal and commercial banking businesses benefited from higher deposit margins, reflecting a rising rate environment and higher market-related revenues, inclusive of TD Cowen, in the Wholesale Banking segment. Credit conditions continued to normalize throughout the year which resulted in higher PCLs. Expenses were higher, inclusive of TD Cowen, reflecting employee-related expenses including variable compensation and investments in support of business growth. The Bank’s quarterly earnings were impacted by, among other things, seasonality, the number of days in a quarter, the economic environment in Canada and the U.S., and foreign currency translation. 31",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's fourth-quarter 2023 performance showed a significant decline in reported net income, which was $2,886 million, down 57% from the previous year, primarily due to the absence of gains from the terminated First Horizon acquisition-related capital hedging strategy and the sale of Schwab shares, as well as higher non-interest expenses. Adjusted net income decreased by 14% to $3,505 million. Reported diluted EPS fell by 59% to $1.49, while adjusted diluted EPS decreased by 16% to $1.83. Reported revenue dropped by 16% to $13,121 million, but adjusted revenue increased by 8% to $13,185 million. Net interest income decreased slightly, with notable declines in Wholesale Banking and U.S. Retail, partially offset by growth in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking. Non-interest income fell by 29% on a reported basis but rose by 22% on an adjusted basis, driven by higher equity commissions and fees in Wholesale Banking and increased insurance revenue. Provisions for credit losses (PCL) increased, reflecting normalization of credit performance. Non-interest expenses rose due to higher employee-related costs and charges related to the Cowen acquisition. The effective tax rate increased due to changes in the Canadian Federal budget and prior favorable tax impacts. Overall, the bank faced a challenging macroeconomic environment, with higher expenses and credit losses, but benefited from higher deposit margins and market-related revenues in certain segments."

The bank's net interest income showed a slight increase compared to 2022, while non-interest income fluctuated, with a notable decrease in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Total revenue for 2023 was generally lower than in 2022, with significant quarterly variations. The provision for credit losses increased in 2023, indicating a higher expectation of loan defaults. Non-interest expenses rose, particularly in the first quarter of 2023, due to restructuring and acquisition-related charges. The bank's reported net income was significantly lower in 2023 compared to 2022, largely due to pre-tax adjustments for items of note, including charges related to acquisitions and terminated transactions. Adjusted net income, which excludes these items, was more stable. Earnings per share and return on common equity were also lower on a reported basis but showed more consistency when adjusted. The net interest margin remained relatively stable throughout the year. Overall, the bank faced challenges from increased expenses and credit loss provisions, impacting its profitability."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Business Focus For management reporting purposes, the Bank’s operations and activities are organized around the following four key business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The Bank’s other activities are grouped into the Corporate segment. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking serves over 15 million customers in Canadian personal and business banking. Personal Banking provides a comprehensive suite of deposit, saving, payment and lending products and advice through a network of 1,062 branches, 3,438 automated teller machines (ATM), mobile specialized salesforce, and telephone, mobile and internet banking services. Business Banking offers a broad range of customized products and services to help business owners meet their financing, investment, cash management, international trade, and day-to-day banking needs through its network of commercial branches and specialized customer centers. Auto Finance, through its consumer channel, provides flexible financing options to customers at point of sale for automotive and recreational vehicle purchases. Merchant Solutions provides point-of-sale payment solutions for large and small businesses. U.S. Retail includes the Bank’s personal, business banking and wealth management operations in the U.S., as well as the Bank’s investment in Schwab. Operating under the TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank® brand, the U.S. Retail Bank serves over 10 million customers in stores from Maine to Florida, and via auto dealerships and credit card partner business locations nationwide. Personal Banking provides a full range of financial products and services to customers from Maine to the Carolinas and Florida through a network of 1,177 stores, 2,705 ATMs, telephone, and mobile and internet banking services. Business Banking offers a diversified range of products and services to help businesses meet their financing, investment, cash management, international trade, and day-to- day banking needs. Wealth management provides wealth products and services to retail and institutional clients. The contribution from the Bank’s investment in Schwab is reported as equity in net income of an investment in Schwab. Wealth Management and Insurance serves approximately 6 million customers across the wealth and insurance businesses in Canada. Wealth Management offers wealth and asset management products and advice to retail clients in Canada through the direct investing, advice-based, and asset management businesses. Wealth Management also offers asset management products to institutional clients globally. Insurance offers property and casualty insurance through direct response channels and to members of affinity groups, as well as life and health insurance products to customers across Canada. Wholesale Banking serves over 17,000 corporate, government, and institutional clients in key financial markets around the world. Operating under the TD Securities brand, Wholesale Banking offers capital markets and corporate and investment banking services to external clients and provides market access and wholesale banking solutions for the Bank’s wealth and retail operations and their customers. Wholesale Banking’s expertise is supported by a presence across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Corporate segment is comprised of a number of service and control groups, including technology solutions, shared services, treasury and balance sheet management, marketing, human resources, finance, risk management, compliance, anti-money laundering, legal, real estate, and others. Certain costs relating to these functions are allocated to operating business segments. The basis of allocation and methodologies are reviewed periodically to align with management’s evaluation of the Bank’s business segments. Results of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the Bank measures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments the Bank indicates that the measure is adjusted. For further details, refer to Note 28 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a TEB, which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt income, including dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking results is reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the year was $181 million (October 31, 2022 – $149 million). Share of net income from investment in Schwab is reported in the U.S. Retail segment. Amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles, the Bank’s share of acquisition and integration charges associated with Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade, and the Bank’s share of Schwab’s restructuring charges are recorded in the Corporate segment. The “Key Priorities for 2024” section for each business segment, provided on the following pages, is based on the Bank’s views and the assumptions set out in the “Economic Summary and Outlook” section and the actual outcome may be materially different. For more information, refer to the “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section and the “Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results” section. 33",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report outlines its operations across four main business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking, with additional activities grouped under the Corporate segment.

Wholesale Banking, under the TD Securities brand, provides capital markets and corporate banking services to over 17,000 clients globally. The Corporate segment includes various service and control functions, with costs allocated to the operating segments. The report also discusses the use of Taxable Equivalent Basis (TEB) for net interest income in Wholesale Banking and notes adjustments related to the Bank's investment in Schwab. The report highlights that the Bank's performance evaluation is based on adjusted results and ROE, with further details available in the financial statements. Key priorities for 2024 are outlined, with a caution regarding forward-looking statements and potential risk factors."

Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking net income for the year was $6,688 million, an increase of $130 million, or 2%, compared with last year, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher PCL and non-interest expenses. ROE for the year was 36.8%, compared with 42.3% last year. Revenue for the year was $18,317 million, an increase of $1,731 million, or 10%, compared with last year. Net interest income was $14,192 million, an increase of $1,796 million, or 14%, reflecting higher margins and volume growth. Average loan volumes increased $32 billion, or 6%, reflecting 5% growth in personal loans and 11% growth in business loans. Average deposit volumes increased $9 billion, or 2%, reflecting 7% growth in personal deposits, partially offset by 5% decline in business deposits. Net interest margin was 2.77%, an increase of 21 bps from last year, primarily due to higher margins on deposits reflecting rising interest rates, partially offset by lower margins on loans. Non-interest income was $4,125 million, a decrease of $65 million, or 2%, compared with last year, reflecting a prior years’ adjustment and lower fee revenue. PCL for the year was $1,343 million, an increase of $852 million, compared with last year. PCL – impaired was $1,013 million, an increase of $374 million, or 59%, reflecting some normalization of credit performance in the consumer lending portfolios and credit migration in the commercial lending portfolios. PCL – performing was $330 million, compared with a recovery of $148 million in the prior year. This year’s performing provisions were largely recorded in the consumer lending portfolios, reflecting current credit conditions and volume growth. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.25%, an increase of 15 bps. Non-interest expenses for the year were $7,700 million, an increase of $524 million, or 7%, compared with last year. The increase primarily reflects higher technology spend and higher employee-related expenses supporting business growth, and higher non-credit provisions. The efficiency ratio for the year was 42.0%, compared with 43.3% last year. Slower growth is expected for Canada’s economy for the second consecutive year in fiscal 2024 with recession risks remaining elevated. The lagged effects of this year’s sharp interest rate hikes are expected to weigh on consumer and business spending, thus constraining overall revenue growth for Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking. Further growth in the number of customers in large part due to strongly rising immigration should provide ongoing support to revenue. However, this positive impact on revenues is expected to be counterbalanced by both a potential further adjustment in housing markets and interest-rate cuts. PCL is expected to increase, reflecting continued normalization of credit conditions and volume growth. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking will continue to manage expenses prudently, investing in distribution capabilities to serve more customers and enhance their experience, and continuing to invest in technology and platforms to purposefully build for the future to meet evolving needs of customers, colleagues and communities. We believe TD’s customer centric and digitally enabled Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking franchise is well-positioned to execute on its growth opportunities. 38",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key achievements and strategies. The bank focused on enhancing operational efficiency through automation and the Next Evolution of Work (NEW) model, which aims to streamline decision-making and improve customer experience. TD expanded its personalized payment experiences and rewards, notably through partnerships with Amazon and Starbucks. The bank was recognized as the Best Consumer Digital Bank in Canada and North America for the third consecutive year, with its mobile app ranking #1 in customer satisfaction and active users in Canada.\n\nTD emphasized diversity and inclusion, advancing women into leadership roles and supporting underrepresented groups through sponsorship programs. The bank also contributed to community well-being by opening a branch staffed entirely by Indigenous colleagues and expanding services for diverse customer segments.\n\nFinancially, TD reported a 2% increase in net income to $6,688 million, driven by higher revenue but offset by increased provisions for credit losses (PCL) and non-interest expenses. The bank's net interest income rose by 14%, while non-interest income slightly decreased. The efficiency ratio improved to 42.0%.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, TD plans to enhance omni-channel distribution, deepen customer relationships, and focus on financial inclusion and education. The bank anticipates slower economic growth in Canada, with elevated recession risks and potential interest rate cuts impacting revenue. However, rising immigration is expected to support customer growth. TD aims to manage expenses prudently while investing in technology and distribution capabilities to meet evolving customer needs."

In addition, the value of tax-exempt interest income is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value.

On an adjusted basis, net income was $5,854 million (US$4,343 million), an increase of $330 million (US$52 million), or 6% (1% in U.S. dollars). The reported and adjusted ROE for the year was 13.6% and 14.2%, respectively, compared with 14.2% and 14.0%, respectively, last year. U.S. Retail net income includes contributions from the U.S. Retail Bank and the Bank’s investment in Schwab. Reported net income for the year from the Bank’s investment in Schwab was $939 million (US$695 million) a decrease of $136 million (US$145 million), or 13% (17% in U.S. dollars), reflecting lower bank deposit account fees and lower trading revenue as well as higher expenses, partially offset by higher net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees. U.S. Retail Bank reported net income for the year was $4,656 million (US$3,456 million), an increase of $111 million or 2% (a decrease of US$74 million or 2%) compared with last year, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses including acquisition and integration-related charges for the terminated First Horizon transaction and higher PCL. U.S. Retail Bank adjusted net income was $4,915 million (US$3,648 million), an increase of $466 million (US$197 million), or 10% (6% in U.S. dollars), reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses and higher PCL. U.S. Retail Bank revenue is derived from personal and business banking, and wealth management businesses. Reported revenue for the year was US$10,709 million, an increase of US$1,077 million, or 11%, compared with last year. On an adjusted basis, revenue increased US$1,254 million, or 13%. Net interest income of US$8,925 million, increased US$1,488 million, or 20%, driven by the benefit of higher deposit margins from the rising rate environment, partially offset by lower deposit volumes. Net interest margin was 3.15%, an increase of 61 bps, as higher margin on deposits reflecting the rising interest rate environment was partially offset by lower income from PPP loan forgiveness and lower margin on loans. Reported non-interest income was US$1,784 million, a decrease of US$411 million, or 19%, compared with last year, reflecting lower overdraft fees and an insurance recovery related to litigation in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, non-interest income decreased US$234 million, or 12%, primarily reflecting lower overdraft fees. Average loan volumes increased US$16 billion, or 10%, compared with last year. Personal loans increased 11%, reflecting good originations and slower payment rates across portfolios. Business loans increased 8%, reflecting good originations from new customer growth, higher commercial line utilization, and slower payment rates, partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness. Excluding PPP loans, business loans increased 10%. Average deposit volumes decreased US$42 billion, or 11%, compared with last year, reflecting a 3% decrease in personal deposits, a 5% decrease in business deposits, and a 23% decrease in sweep deposits. Assets under administration (AUA) were US$37 billion as at October 31, 2023, an increase of US$3 billion, or 9%, compared with last year, reflecting net asset growth. Assets under management (AUM) were US$33 billion as at October 31, 2023, flat compared with last year. PCL for the year was US$687 million, an increase of US$433 million compared with last year. PCL – impaired was US$715 million, an increase of US$311 million, or 77%, reflecting some normalization of credit performance. PCL – performing was a recovery of US$28 million, compared with a recovery of US$150 million in the prior year. U.S. Retail PCL including only the Bank’s share of PCL in the U.S. strategic cards portfolio, as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.38%, or an increase of 22 bps. Reported non-interest expenses for the year were US$6,071 million, an increase of US$707 million, or 13%, compared with last year, reflecting higher employee-related expenses, higher acquisition and integration- related charges for the terminated First Horizon transaction, higher FDIC assessment fees as a result of an increase to FDIC assessment rates effective January 1, 2023, and higher investments in the business. On an adjusted basis, excluding acquisition and integration-related charges for the terminated First Horizon transaction, non-interest expenses increased US$525 million, or 10%. The reported and adjusted efficiency ratios for the year were 56.7% and 54.3%, compared with 55.7% and 56.0%, respectively, last year. Fiscal 2024 is expected to be a challenging year across the entire U.S. banking industry, with potential rate cuts, an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, as well as elevated regulatory expectations and new regulatory requirements. We expect moderate revenue growth driven by loan volume growth, recovering personal and business deposit volumes, continued new customer acquisitions, and increased customer activity in certain areas. PCL is expected to increase over the course of next year, reflecting an ongoing credit normalization and volume growth. We will continue to optimize the balance sheet and execute on programs to generate productivity savings while enabling investments in governance and control, and strategic growth, maintaining our expense management discipline, and enhancing our profitability. Refer to Note 12 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on Schwab. 43",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 annual report highlights several key financial insights for its U.S. Retail segment. The reported net income was $5,595 million (US$4,151 million), slightly down from the previous year, while adjusted net income increased by 6% to $5,854 million (US$4,343 million). The U.S. Retail Bank's net income rose by 2% to $4,656 million (US$3,456 million), with adjusted net income up 10% to $4,915 million (US$3,648 million), driven by higher revenue despite increased non-interest expenses and provisions for credit losses (PCL). Total revenue increased by 11% to US$10,709 million, with net interest income rising 20% due to higher deposit margins. However, non-interest income fell by 19% due to lower overdraft fees and prior-year insurance recoveries. Average loan volumes grew by 10%, while deposit volumes decreased by 11%. The report anticipates a challenging fiscal 2024 with potential rate cuts and regulatory changes, but expects moderate revenue growth and increased PCL due to credit normalization. The bank plans to focus on balance sheet optimization, expense management, and strategic growth."

Wealth Management and Insurance reported net income for the year was $2,118 million, a decrease of $277 million, or 12%, compared with last year, reflecting higher insurance claims and related expenses and lower revenue in the wealth management business, partially offset by increased revenue in the insurance business. The ROE for the year was 38.7%, compared with 46.7% last year. Revenue for the year was $11,280 million, an increase of $420 million, or 4%, compared with last year. Non-interest income was $10,224 million, an increase of $309 million, or 3%, reflecting higher insurance premiums and an increase in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar increase in insurance claims, partially offset by lower transaction and fee-based revenue in the wealth management business. Net interest income was $1,056 million, an increase of $111 million, or 12%, compared with last year, reflecting higher investment income in the insurance business, partially offset by lower deposit volumes in the wealth management business.

AUM were $405 billion as at October 31, 2023, an increase of $8 billion, or 2%, compared with last year, reflecting market appreciation, partially offset by mutual fund redemptions.

Non-interest expenses for the year were $4,709 million, a decrease of $2 million, compared with last year. The efficiency ratio for the year was 41.7%, compared with 43.4% last year. Expected slowdown in economic growth and potential continued market volatility in Canada and the U.S. may impact Wealth Management and Insurance results in fiscal 2024. Notwithstanding these headwinds, Wealth Management and Insurance’s diversified businesses should be well-positioned to deliver against their strategic objectives.

Assets under administration and management grew by 3% and 2%, respectively, due to market appreciation. Insurance claims and related expenses surged by 28%, influenced by changes in discount rates and severe weather events. The efficiency ratio improved slightly to 41.7%. Despite potential economic slowdowns and market volatility, the segment aims to leverage its diversified business model and strategic investments in digital platforms to mitigate these challenges and continue delivering quality services and products."

The current year performing provisions largely reflect credit migration and volume growth. Reported non-interest expenses were $4,760 million, an increase of $1,727 million, or 57%, compared with the prior year, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Cowen Inc. and acquisition and integration-related costs, continued investments in Wholesale Banking’s U.S. dollar strategy, including the hiring of banking, sales and trading, and technology professionals, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. On an adjusted basis, excluding acquisition and integration-related costs, non-interest expenses were $4,326 million, an increase of $1,311 million, or 43%. The operating environment remains challenging, characterized by volatile markets, economic uncertainty, geo-political and ESG considerations, disruptive technologies, intensifying competition, and evolving capital and regulatory requirements.

The addition of TD Cowen to our business enhances TD Securities’ capabilities and competitive position, adding to an increasingly diversified and client- focused business model that is expected to be well positioned to support future growth.

Corporate segment’s reported net loss for the year was $4,389 million, compared with net income of $1,531 million last year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects a net loss from the impact of the terminated First Horizon acquisition-related capital hedging strategy and the payment related to the termination of the transaction, the Stanford litigation settlement, gain on sale of Schwab shares in the prior year, the recognition of a provision for income taxes in connection with the CRD and increase in the Canadian federal tax rate for fiscal 2022, and restructuring charges.

The increase reflects higher revenues, a net gain from mitigation of interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition, and gain on sale of Schwab shares, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses, and higher PCL. On an adjusted basis, net income for the year was $15,425 million, an increase of $776 million, or 5%, compared with prior year. The reported ROE for the year was 18.0%, compared with 15.5% prior year. The adjusted ROE for the year was 15.9%, compared with 15.9% prior year. Reported diluted EPS for the year was $9.47, an increase of 23%, compared with $7.72 prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS for the year was $8.36, a 6% increase, compared with $7.91 prior year. Reported revenue was $49,032 million, an increase of $6,339 million, or 15%, compared with prior year. Adjusted revenue was $46,170 million, an increase of $3,477 million, or 8%, compared with the prior year. Reported net interest income for the year was $27,353 million, an increase of $3,222 million, or 13%, compared with prior year. The increase reflects volume and margin growth in the personal and commercial banking businesses, the impact of foreign exchange translation, and higher net interest income in Wholesale Banking, partially offset by lower income from PPP loan forgiveness. Adjusted net interest income was $27,307 million, an increase of $3,176 million, or 13%. NON-INTEREST INCOME Reported non-interest income for the year was $21,679 million, an increase of $3,117 million, or 17%, compared with prior year, primarily reflecting the net gain from mitigation of interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition, and gain on sale of Schwab shares. Adjusted non-interest income was $18,863 million, an increase of $301 million, or 2%, reflecting higher fee-based revenue in the banking and wealth businesses, and higher insurance revenues reflecting prior year premium rebates for customers, and volumes. These were partially offset by lower transaction fees in the wealth business, a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in insurance claims, markdowns in certain loan underwriting commitments from widening credit spreads in Wholesale Banking, and lower underwriting revenue. PCL was $1,067 million, compared with a recovery of $224 million in the prior year. PCL – impaired was $1,437 million, an increase of $128 million, reflecting some normalization of credit performance. PCL – performing was a recovery of $370 million, compared with a recovery of $1,533 million prior year. The current year performing release reflects improved credit conditions. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.14%. Insurance claims and related expenses were $2,900 million, an increase of $193 million, or 7%, compared with prior year, reflecting increased driving activity, inflationary costs and more severe weather-related events, partially offset by the impact of a higher discount rate which resulted in a similar decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income and favourable prior years’ claims development. NON-INTEREST EXPENSES Reported non-interest expenses for the year were $24,641 million, an increase of $1,565 million, or 7%, compared with prior year, reflecting higher employee-related expenses, higher spend supporting business growth, and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by prior year store optimization costs. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses were $24,359 million, an increase of $1,450 million, or 6%. Reported total income and other taxes increased by $534 million, or 10.2%, compared with prior year, reflecting an increase in income tax expense of $365 million, or 10.1%, and an increase in other taxes of $169 million, or 10.4%. Adjusted total income and other taxes increased by $106 million from prior year, or 2.0%, reflecting an increase in other taxes of $169 million, or 10.4%, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of $63 million, or 1.7%. The Bank’s reported effective income tax rate was 19.5% for 2022, compared with 21.1% prior year. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the favourable tax impact of earnings mix, the sale of Schwab shares, and the recognition of unused tax losses, partially offset by the impact of higher pre-tax income. For a reconciliation of the Bank’s effective income tax rate with the Canadian statutory income tax rate, refer to Note 25 of the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank reported its investments in Schwab using the equity method of accounting. Schwab’s tax expense (2022: $319 million; 2021: $280 million) was not part of the Bank’s effective tax rate. Total assets were $1,918 billion as at October 31, 2022, an increase of $189 billion, or 11%, from October 31, 2021. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the depreciation in the Canadian dollar increased total assets by $79 billion, or approximately 5%. The increase in total assets reflects loans, net of allowances for loan losses of $108 billion, debt securities at amortized cost (DSAC), net of allowance for credit losses of $74 billion, derivatives of $49 billion, and non-trading financial assets at FVTPL of $2 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $20 billion, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) of $9 billion, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements of $7 billion, trading loans, securities, and other of $4 billion, investment in Schwab of $3 billion, other assets of $1 billion. Total liabilities were $1,806 billion as at October 31, 2022, an increase of $177 billion, or 11%, from October 31, 2021. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the depreciation in the Canadian dollar increased total liabilities by $83 billion, or approximately 5%. The increase in total liabilities reflects deposits of $105 billion, financial liabilities designated at FVTPL of $49 billion, derivatives of $34 billion, other liabilities of $4 billion and trading deposits of $1 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements of $16 billion. Equity was $111 billion as at October 31, 2022, an increase of $12 billion from October 31, 2021. The increase primarily reflects an increase in retained earnings, and preferred shares and other equity instruments, partially offset by a decrease in AOCI. The decrease in AOCI is primarily driven by losses on cash flow hedges and from the Bank’s share of the other comprehensive loss from the investment in Schwab, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2022 financial performance showed significant growth, with reported net income rising by 22% to $17,429 million, driven by higher revenues, gains from interest rate volatility mitigation, and the sale of Schwab shares. Adjusted net income increased by 5% to $15,425 million. The reported return on equity (ROE) improved to 18.0%, while adjusted ROE remained stable at 15.9%. Reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 23% to $9.47, and adjusted diluted EPS rose by 6% to $8.36. Total reported revenue grew by 15% to $49,032 million, with adjusted revenue up by 8% to $46,170 million. Net interest income increased by 13%, reflecting growth in personal and commercial banking and foreign exchange impacts. Non-interest income rose by 17%, primarily due to gains from strategic transactions, while adjusted non-interest income saw a modest 2% increase. Provisions for credit losses (PCL) were $1,067 million, indicating a normalization of credit performance. Non-interest expenses increased by 7% due to higher employee-related costs and business growth investments. The effective income tax rate decreased to 19.5%, influenced by favorable tax impacts. Total assets grew by 11% to $1,918 billion, with significant contributions from loans and debt securities, while total liabilities also increased by 11% to $1,806 billion. Equity rose by $12 billion, driven by retained earnings and equity instruments, despite a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) due to losses on cash flow hedges and foreign exchange impacts."

The impact of foreign exchange translation from the depreciation in the Canadian dollar increased total assets by $16 billion. The increase in total assets reflects an increase in loans, net of allowances for loan losses of $65 billion, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements of $44 billion, other assets of $16 billion, trading loans, securities, and other of $8 billion, financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss of $1 billion and investment in Schwab of $1 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $41 billion, debt securities at amortized cost of $35 billion, derivative assets of $16 billion, and non- trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss of $4 billion. Cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks decreased $41 billion primarily reflecting cash management activities. Trading loans, securities, and other increased $8 billion primarily in equity securities, trading loans, the impact of Cowen acquisition and foreign exchange translation partially offset by commodities held for trading. Non-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss decreased $4 billion primarily reflecting maturities and sales. Derivative assets decreased $16 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss increased $1 billion primarily reflecting new issuances, partially offset by maturities. Debt securities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses decreased $35 billion primarily reflecting maturities and sales of government securities, partially offset by new investments and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements increased $44 billion primarily reflecting an increase in volume. Loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased $65 billion reflecting volume growth in residential real estate secured lending, and business and government loans and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Investment in Schwab increased $1 billion primarily reflecting the impact of the Bank’s share of Schwab’s net income. Other assets increased $16 billion primarily reflecting increase in amounts receivable from brokers, dealers and clients due to higher volumes of pending trades, the acquired held for sale businesses, goodwill and intangibles as a result of the Cowen acquisition, deferred tax assets and accrued interest, partially offset by a decrease in customers’ liabilities under acceptances and current income tax receivable. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS54 Total liabilities were $1,845 billion as at October 31, 2023, an increase of $39 billion from October 31, 2022. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the depreciation in the Canadian dollar increased total liabilities by $17 billion. The increase in total liabilities reflects an increase in obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements of $39 billion, financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss of $29 billion, other liabilities of $17 billion and trading deposits of $7 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in deposits of $32 billion, derivative liabilities of $19 billion and subordinated notes and debentures $2 billion. Trading deposits increased $7 billion primarily reflecting new issuances, partially offset by maturities. Derivative liabilities decreased $19 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss increased $29 billion primarily reflecting new issuances and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by maturities. Deposits decreased $32 billion reflecting lower volumes in personal (including Schwab deposits) and bank deposits, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation and higher volumes in business and government deposits. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $39 billion primarily reflecting an increase in volume. Subordinated notes and debentures decreased $2 billion primarily reflecting redemptions. Other liabilities increased $17 billion primarily reflecting increase in amounts payable to brokers, dealers and clients due to higher volumes of pending trades, increase in liabilities related to structured entities, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other items as a result of the Cowen acquisition, accrued interest, and increase in provision for the Stanford litigation settlement, partially offset by a decrease in acceptances. Equity was $112 billion as at October 31, 2023, an increase of $1 billion from October 31, 2022. The increase reflects common shares issued with a 2% discount under the dividend reinvestment plan, net of share repurchases, and gains in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by lower retained earnings. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive is primarily driven by the impact of foreign currency translation. The retained earnings decreased as the net income for the year is offset by the dividends paid and the premium on the repurchase of common shares. Credit Portfolio Quality • Loans and acceptances, net of allowance for loan losses were $914 billion, an increase of $61 billion compared with last year. • Impaired loans net of Stage 3 allowances were $2,277 million, an increase of $531 million compared with last year. • Provision for credit losses was $2,933 million, compared with $1,067 million last year. • Total allowance for credit losses including off-balance sheet positions increased by $823 million to $8,189 million. The Bank increased its loans and acceptances net of allowance for loan losses by $61 billion, or 7%, from the prior year, primarily reflecting volume growth in the real estate secured lending and business and government portfolios, and the impact of foreign exchange. While the majority of the Bank’s credit risk exposure is related to loans and acceptances, the Bank also engaged in activities that have off- balance sheet credit risk. These include credit instruments and derivative financial instruments, as explained in Note 30 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank’s loan portfolio continued to be concentrated in Canadian and U.S. consumer lending, comprised of residential mortgages, consumer instalment and other personal loans, and credit card loans, representing 63% of total loans net of Stage 3 allowances, flat compared with 2022. During the year, these portfolios increased by $40 billion, or 8%, and totalled $576 billion at year end. Residential mortgages represented 35% of total loans net of Stage 3 allowances in 2023, up 1% from 2022. Consumer instalment and other personal loans, and credit card loans were 28% of total loans net of Stage 3 allowances in 2023, flat compared with 2022. The Bank’s business and government loan portfolio was 37% of total loans net of Stage 3 allowances, down 1% from 2022. The largest business and government sector concentrations in Canada were the Real estate and Financial sectors, which comprised 6% and 2% of net loans, respectively. Real estate and Financial sectors were the largest U.S. sector concentrations in 2023, representing 4% and 2% of net loans, respectively. Geographically, the credit portfolio remained concentrated in Canada. In 2023, the percentage of loans net of Stage 3 allowances held in Canada was 66%, flat compared with 2022. The largest Canadian regional exposure was in Ontario, which represented 39% of total loans net of Stage 3 allowances for 2023, flat compared to the prior year. The remaining credit portfolio was predominantly in the U.S., which represented 33% of loans net of Stage 3 allowances, up 1% from 2022. Exposures to acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans, and other geographic regions were relatively small. The largest U.S. regional exposures were in New York, New England, and Florida which represented 6%, 5%, and 3% of total loans net of Stage 3 allowances, respectively, and consistent with the prior year. Under IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), the Bank calculates allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) on DSAC and debt securities at FVOCI. The Bank has $374 billion in such debt securities of which $374 billion are performing securities (Stage 1 and 2) and none are impaired. The allowance for credit losses on DSAC and debt securities at FVOCI was $2 million and $2 million, respectively.

Retail real estate secured lending includes mortgages and lines of credit to North American consumers to satisfy financing needs including home purchases and refinancing. While the Bank retains first lien on the majority of pr operties held as security, there is a small portion of loans with second liens, but most of these are behind a TD mortgage that is in first position. In Canada, credit policies are designed so that the combined exposure of all uninsured facilities on one property does not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination. Lending at a higher loan-to-value ratio is permitted by legislation but requires default insurance. This insurance is contractual coverage for the life of eligible facilities and protects the Bank’s real estate secured lending portfolio against potential losses caused by borrowers’ default. The Bank may also purchase default insurance on lower loan-to-value ratio loans. The insurance is provided by either government-backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers. In the U.S., for residential mortgage originations, mortgage insurance is usually obtained from either government-backed entities or appr oved private mortgage insurers when the loan-to-value exceeds 80% of the collateral value at origination. The Bank regularly performs stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio as part of its overall stress testing program. This is done with a view to determine the extent to which the portfolio would be vulnerable to a sever e downturn in economic conditions. The effect of severe changes in house prices, interest rates, and unemployment levels are among the factors considered when assessing the impact on credit losses and the Bank’s overall profitability. A variety of portfolio segments, including dwelling type and geographical regions, are examined during the exercise to determine whether specific vulnerabilities exist.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet Growth**: Total assets increased by $39 billion to $1,957 billion as of October 31, 2023, primarily due to growth in loans, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, and other assets. This growth was partially offset by decreases in cash deposits and debt securities.\n\n2. **Liabilities and Equity**: Total liabilities also rose by $39 billion to $1,845 billion, driven by increases in obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements and financial liabilities. Equity increased slightly by $1 billion to $112 billion, reflecting gains in accumulated other comprehensive income and common share issuances.\n\n3. **Credit Portfolio Quality**: Loans and acceptances, net of allowance for loan losses, increased by $61 billion, with impaired loans rising by $531 million. The provision for credit losses more than doubled to $2,933 million, indicating a cautious approach to potential credit risks.\n\n4. **Geographic and Sector Concentration**: The credit portfolio remains concentrated in Canadian and U.S. consumer lending, with residential mortgages and consumer loans making up a significant portion. The largest regional exposure in Canada is Ontario, while in the U.S., New York and New England are prominent.\n\n5. **Real Estate Lending**: The bank's real estate secured lending portfolio grew, with a notable increase in uninsured loans. Stress tests are regularly conducted to assess the portfolio's vulnerability to economic downturns.\n\nOverall, the report reflects TD Bank's strategic growth in assets and liabilities, a focus on managing credit risk, and a strong presence in North American consumer lending markets."

All figures are calculated based on current customer payment amounts, including voluntary payments larger than the original contractual amounts and/or other voluntary prepayments. The most recent customer payment amount may exceed the original contractual amount due. Balances with a remaining amortization longer than 30 years primarily reflect Canadian variable rate mortgages where interest rate increases relative to current customer payment levels have resulted in a longer current amortization period.

The largest regional concentration of net impaired loans in the U.S. was in New York, representing 21% of total net impaired loans, compared with 18% in the prior year.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key insights regarding its residential mortgage portfolio and impaired loans. The report provides a breakdown of the remaining amortization periods for residential mortgages in Canada and the U.S., noting that a significant portion of Canadian variable rate mortgages have extended amortization periods due to interest rate increases. At renewal, these mortgages revert to their original amortization schedules, potentially requiring higher payments.\n\nThe report also discusses the average loan-to-value ratios for newly originated and acquired residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit, with Canadian regions showing slight variations. The overall loan-to-value ratio remained stable at 68% for both 2022 and 2023.\n\nImpaired loans increased significantly, with a 32% rise in gross impaired loans compared to the previous year. In Canada, net impaired loans increased by 60%, driven by residential mortgages and consumer loans. In the U.S., net impaired loans rose by 19%, with business and government loans showing notable increases. Geographically, 34% of net impaired loans were in Canada, with Ontario having the highest concentration, while 66% were in the U.S., with New York leading in regional concentration."

The allowance for credit losses including off-balance sheet positions of $8,189 million as at October 31, 2023, was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impair ed loans of $1,036 million, Stage 2 allowance of $4,000 million, and Stage 1 allowance of $3,149 million, and allowance for debt securities of $4 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. Stage 3 allowances (impaired) The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $272 million, or 36%, compared with last year , reflecting some normalization of credit performance, and the impact of foreign exchange. Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowances (performing) As at October 31, 2023, the performing allowance was $7,149 million, up from $6,599 million as at October 31, 2022. The increase this year largely reflected credit conditions, including some credit migration, volume growth, and the impact of foreign exchange. The allowance increase included $60 million attributable to the partners’ share of the U.S. strategic cards portfolios. The performing allowance for debt securities increased by $1 million compared with last year. Forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables deemed to be pr edictive of ECLs based on the Bank’s experience, is used to determine ECL scenarios and associated probability weights to determine the probability-weighted ECLs. Each quarter, all base forecast macroeconomic variables are refreshed, resulting in new upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios. The probability weightings assigned to each ECL scenario are also reviewed each quarter and updated as required, as part of the Bank’s ECL governance process. As a result of periodic reviews and quarterly updates, the allowance for credit losses may be revised to reflect updates in loss estimates based on the Bank’s recent loss experience and its forward-looking views. The Bank periodically reviews the methodology and has performed certain additional quantitative and qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on forward-looking information. The probability-weighted allowance for credit losses reflects the Bank’s forwar d-looking views. To the extent that certain anticipated effects cannot be fully incorporated into quantitative models, management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in determining the amount of ECLs. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. The PCL is the amount charged to income to bring the total allowance for cr edit losses, including both Stage 1 and 2 allowances (performing) and Stage 3 allowance (impaired), to a level that management considers adequate to absorb expected and incurred credit-related losses in the Bank’s loan portfolio. Provisions are reduced by any recoveries in the year. In Canada, PCL – impaired related to residential mortgages, consumer instalment and other personal loans, and cr edit card loans was $811 million, an increase of $246 million, or 44%, compared to 2022 reflecting some normalization of credit performance. PCL – impaired related to business and government loans was $199 million, an increase of $102 million, compared to $97 million in the prior year, largely reflecting credit migration. In the U.S., PCL – impaired related to residential mortgages, consumer instalment and other personal loans, and cr edit card loans was $1,279 million, an increase of $536 million, or 72%, compared to 2022, largely related to some normalization of credit performance and the impact of foreign exchange. PCL – impaired related to business and government loans was $197 million, an increase of $160 million, compared to $37 million in the prior year, largely reflecting credit migration and the impact of foreign exchange. Geographically, the largest regional concentration of PCL – impaired in Canada was in Ontario. The largest r egional concentration of PCL – impaired in the U.S. was in New York.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key insights regarding impaired loans and allowances for credit losses.

The Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans rose by 36% to $1,036 million, reflecting normalization of credit performance and foreign exchange impacts. The performing allowance (Stages 1 and 2) also increased to $7,149 million, driven by credit conditions, volume growth, and foreign exchange. In Canada, impaired loans related to residential mortgages and personal loans saw a 44% increase, while business loans increased by 105%. In the U.S., impaired loans for personal and credit card loans rose by 72%, and business loans increased significantly, largely due to credit migration and foreign exchange.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS68 THE BANK’S CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES The Bank’s capital management objectives are: • To be an appropriately capitalized financial institution as determined by: – the Bank’s Risk Appetite Statement (RAS); – capital requirements defined by relevant regulatory authorities; and – the Bank’s internal assessment of capital requirements, including stress test analysis, consistent with the Bank’s risk profile and risk tolerance levels. • To have the most economic weighted-average cost of capital achievable, while preserving the appropriate mix of capital elements to meet targeted capitalization levels. • Manage capital levels, in order to: – insulate the Bank from unexpected loss events; – support and facilitate business growth and/or acquisitions consistent with the Bank’s strategy and risk appetite; and – maintain stakeholder confidence in the Bank. • To support strong external debt ratings, in order to manage the Bank’s overall cost of funds and to maintain access to required funding. These objectives are applied in a manner consistent with the Bank’s overall objective of providing a satisfactory return on shareholders’ equity. The Bank’s capital is primarily derived from common shareholders and retained earnings. Other sources of capital include the Bank’s preferred shareholders, limited recourse capital noteholders, and holders of the Bank’s subordinated debt. The Treasury and Balance Sheet Management (TBSM) group manages capital for the Bank and is responsible for forecasting and monitoring compliance with capital targets, on a consolidated basis, with oversight provided by Asset/Liability and Capital Committee (ALCO). The Board of Directors (the “Board”) oversees capital adequacy risk management. The Bank continues to hold sufficient capital levels to ensure that flexibility is maintained to grow operations, both organically and through strategic acquisitions. The strong capital ratios are the result of the Bank’s internal capital generation, management of the balance sheet, and periodic issuance of capital securities. Economic capital is the Bank’s internal measure of capital requirements and is one of the key components in the Bank’s internal assessment of capital adequacy. The Economic capital framework assesses all material risks of the Bank and determines the amount of risk-based capital required to cover unexpected losses from the Bank’s business operations in a manner consistent with the Bank’s capital management objectives. The Bank uses internal models for this assessment and the characteristics of these models are described in the “Managing Risk” section of this document. The Bank operates its capital regime under the Basel Capital Framework. Consequently, in addition to addressing Pillar 1 risks covering credit risk, market risk, and operational risk, the Bank’s economic capital framework captures other material Pillar 2 risks including non-trading market risk (interest rate risk in the banking book), additional credit risk due to concentration (commercial and wholesale portfolios) and risks classified as “Other”, namely business risk, insurance risk, and risks associated with the Bank’s significant investments. The framework also captures diversification benefits across risk types and business segments. Please refer to the “Economic Capital and Risk-Weighted Assets by Segment” section for a business segment breakdown of the Bank’s economic capital. Capital requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) are commonly referred to as Basel III. Under Basel III, Total Capital consists of three components, namely CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III introduced a non-risk sensitive leverage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage exposure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. TD manages its regulatory capital in accordance with OSFI’s implementation of the Basel III Capital Framework. OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III OSFI’s Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) and Leverage Requirements (LR) guidelines detail how the Basel III capital rules apply to Canadian banks. The Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) level was increased to 3% as of February 1, 2023. The 50 bps increase from the previous level of 2.5% reflected OSFI’s assessment that systemic vulnerabilities remain elevated. In addition, OSFI increased the DSB range from 0 to 4%, instead of the previous 0 to 2.5% to allow the DSB to remain responsive to an uncertain environment. On February 1, 2023, OSFI implemented revised capital rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. These revised rules include revisions to the calculation of credit risk and operational risk requirements, and revisions to the LR Guideline to include a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the regulatory minimum requirement of 3.0%. This buffer will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report outlines its capital management objectives, which focus on maintaining appropriate capitalization levels as per regulatory requirements, internal assessments, and risk appetite. The bank aims to achieve an optimal weighted-average cost of capital while ensuring sufficient capital to absorb unexpected losses, support growth, and maintain stakeholder confidence. The Treasury and Balance Sheet Management group oversees capital management, with the Board of Directors providing oversight on capital adequacy risk. TD Bank operates under the Basel Capital Framework, addressing both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 risks, and utilizes an economic capital framework to assess capital adequacy. The bank adheres to OSFI's implementation of Basel III, which includes capital adequacy and leverage requirements. Recent changes include an increase in the Domestic Stability Buffer to 3% and revised capital rules to better align with domestic needs, reflecting ongoing systemic vulnerabilities."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS69 The table below summarizes OSFI’s published regulatory minimum capital targets for the Bank effective October 31, 2023. The Bank is in compliance with these minimum capital targets. Regulatory Capital and TLAC Target Ratios Minimum Capital Conservation Buffer D-SIB / G-SIB Surcharge1 Pillar 1 Regulatory Target2 DSB Pillar 1 & 2 Regulatory Target CET1 4.5% 2.5% 1.0% 8.0% 3.0% 11.0% Tier 1 6.0 2.5 1.0 9.5 3.0 12.5 Total Capital 8.0 2.5 1.0 11.5 3.0 14.5 Leverage 3.0 n/a 0.5 3.5 n/a 3.5 TLAC 18.0 2.5 1.0 21.5 3.0 24.5 TLAC Leverage 6.75 n/a 0.50 7.25 n/a 7.25 1 The higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharge applies to risk weighted capital. The D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the Bank’s 1% G-SIB additional common equity requirement for risk weighted capital. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%. OSFI’s LR Guideline includes a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer set at 50% of a D-SIB’s higher loss absorbency risk-weighted requirements, effectively 0.50%. This buffer also applies to the TLAC Leverage ratio. 2 The Bank’s countercyclical buffer requirement is 0% as of October 31, 2023. In fiscal 2020, OSFI introduced a number of measures to support D-SIBs’ ability to supply credit to the economy during an expected period of disruption related to COVID-19 and market conditions. While most of these measures have been unwound, some continue to be in effect during the 2022 or 2023 reporting periods and are summarized below. • On March 27, 2020, OSFI announced certain measures, including: – Transitional arrangements for ECL provisioning available under the Basel Framework would be introduced. The adjustment allowed a portion of the increase in Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowances relative to a baseline level to be included in CET1 Capital, rather than Tier 2 Capital, as the CAR guideline specifies. The baseline level is the sum of Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowances as at the first quarter of 2020 (for October year-end deposit-taking institutions (DTIs)). This increase is tax effected and is subject to a scaling factor. The scaling factor remained at 25% in 2022, and was eliminated in 2023. – The loan exposures in the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) Program, which was funded by the Government of Canada, can be excluded from the risk-based capital ratios and from leverage ratio calculations. For the Export Development Canada Business Credit Availability Program, the government-guaranteed portion of the loan is treated as a sovereign exposure, with the remaining portion treated as a loan to the borrower. The entire amount of the loan is included in leverage ratio calculations. As of September 14, 2023, the repayment deadline for eligible CEBA loan holders to qualify for partial loan forgiveness was extended to January 18, 2024. • On April 9, 2020, OSFI announced DTIs could temporarily exclude exposures from central bank reserves and sovereign-issued securities that qualify as High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline from the leverage ratio measures. The measure expired on April 1, 2023. Capital Position and Capital Ratios The Basel framework allows qualifying banks to determine capital levels consistent with the way they measure, manage, and mitigate risks. It specifies methodologies for the measurement of credit, trading market, and operational risks. The Bank uses the Internal Ratings-Based approaches to credit risk for all material portfolios. For accounting purposes, IFRS is followed for consolidation of subsidiaries and joint ventures. For regulatory capital purposes, all subsidiaries of the Bank are consolidated except for insurance subsidiaries which are deconsolidated and follow prescribed treatment per OSFI’s CAR guidelines. Insurance subsidiaries are subject to their own capital adequacy reporting, such as OSFI’s Minimum Capital Test for General Insurance and Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test for Life and Health. Some of the Bank’s subsidiaries are individually regulated by either OSFI or other regulators. Many of these entities have minimum capital requirements which may limit the Bank’s ability to extract capital or funds for other uses. As at October 31, 2023, the Bank’s CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios were 14.4%, 16.2%, and 18.1%, respectively. The decrease in the Bank’s CET1 Capital ratio from 16.2% as at October 31, 2022, was primarily attributable to RWA growth across various segments (including an increase in RWA as a result of the Cowen acquisition), the impact of the terminated First Horizon acquisition-related capital hedging strategy, the Stanford litigation settlement, common shares repurchased for cancellation, and an increase in the goodwill and intangibles deduction related to the Cowen acquisition. CET1 was also impacted by the CRD, foreign exchange hedging of the First Horizon purchase price, and the elimination of the scaling factor related to OSFI’s transition arrangements for ECL provisioning. The impact of the foregoing items was partially offset by organic growth, and the issuance of common shares pursuant to the Bank’s dividend reinvestment plan.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights its compliance with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) regulatory minimum capital targets as of October 31, 2023. The report details the bank's capital ratios, including CET1 at 14.4%, Tier 1 at 16.2%, and Total Capital at 18.1%. These figures reflect a decrease from the previous year, primarily due to risk-weighted asset (RWA) growth, the Cowen acquisition, the termination of a capital hedging strategy related to the First Horizon acquisition, and other factors like litigation settlements and share repurchases. The report also notes the impact of transitional measures introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which have been phased out. Additionally, the bank's capital management follows the Basel framework and OSFI guidelines, with specific treatments for insurance subsidiaries and other regulated entities."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS70 As at October 31, 2023, the Bank’s leverage ratio was 4.4%. Compared with the Bank’s leverage ratio of 4.9% at October 31, 2022, the decrease was attributable primarily to increased leverage exposures across various segments, largely driven by the expiration of the temporary exclusion of central bank reserves in determining leverage exposure, common shares repurchased for cancellation, and an increase in the goodwill and intangibles deduction related to the Cowen acquisition, partially offset by organic capital growth and the issuance of common shares pursuant to the Bank’s dividend reinvestment plan. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital CET1 Capital was $82.3 billion as at October 31, 2023. Earnings contributed the majority of CET1 Capital growth in the year. Capital management funding activities during the year included common share issuance of $1.8 billion under the dividend reinvestment plan and from stock option exercises, offset by common shares repurchased of $4.3 billion. Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital Tier 1 Capital was $92.8 billion as at October 31, 2023, consisting of CET1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 Capital of $82.3 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively. The Bank’s Tier 1 Capital management activities during the year consisted of the redemption of one Tier 1-qualifying capital instrument as follows: • On October 31, 2023, the bank redeemed all of its 16,000,000 outstanding Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate Reset Class A First Preferred Shares, Series 20 (the “Series 20 Shares”) at the price of $25.00 per Series 20 Share for an aggregate total of approximately $400 million. Tier 2 Capital was $10.9 billion as at October 31, 2023. Tier 2 Capital management activities during the year consisted of the redemption of on Tier 2-qualifying capital instrument as follows: • On September 14, 2023, the bank redeemed all of its $1.75 billion 3.589% Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC) subordinated debentures due September 14, 2028 at a redemption price of 100 per cent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. The Bank’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) is an integrated enterprise-wide process that encompasses the governance, management, and control of risk and capital functions within the Bank. It provides a framework for relating risks to capital requirements through the Bank’s capital modelling and stress testing practices which help inform the Bank’s overall capital adequacy requirements. The ICAAP is led by TBSM and is supported by numerous functional areas who collectively help assess the Bank’s internal capital adequacy. This assessment evaluates the capacity to bear risk in congruence with the Bank’s risk profile and RAS. TBSM assesses and monitors the overall adequacy of the Bank’s available capital in relation to both internal and regulatory capital requirements under normal and stressed conditions. On November 29, 2023, the Board approved a dividend in an amount of one dollar and two cents ($1.02) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the Bank for the quarter ending January 31, 2024, payable on and after January 31, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 10, 2024. At October 31, 2023, the quarterly dividend was $0.96 per common share. Common share cash dividends declared and paid during the year totalled $3.84 per share (2022 – $3.56), representing a payout ratio of 48%, consistent with the Bank’s target payout range of 40-50% of adjusted earnings. For cash dividends payable on the Bank’s preferred shares, refer to Note 20 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. As at October 31, 2023, 1,791 million common shares were outstanding (2022 – 1,821 million). The Bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan for its common shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on common shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion or purchased from the open market at market price. During the year ended October 31, 2023, under the dividend reinvestment plan, the Bank issued 3.7 million common shares from treasury with no discount and 16.8 million common shares with a 2% discount. During the year ended October 31, 2022, under the dividend reinvestment plan, the Bank issued 2.5 million common shares from treasury with no discount and 14.5 million common shares with a 2% discount. On June 21, 2023, the Bank announced that the TSX and OSFI approved the Bank’s previously announced normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to repurchase for cancellation up to 30 million of its common shares (June NCIB). On August 28, 2023, the Bank announced that the TSX and OSFI had approved the launch of a new NCIB to repurchase for cancellation up to 90 million of its common shares (August NCIB) upon completion of the repurchase for cancellation of 30 million of its common shares under the June NCIB. The June NCIB terminated on August 30, 2023 and the August NCIB commenced on August 31, 2023. During the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank repurchased 52 million common shares under the June NCIB and the August NCIB, at an average price of $82.356 per share for a total amount of $4.3 billion. RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS Based on Basel III, RWA are calculated for each of credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Details of the Bank’s RWA are included in the following table.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 annual report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Leverage Ratio**: As of October 31, 2023, the bank's leverage ratio decreased to 4.4% from 4.9% in 2022, primarily due to increased leverage exposures, the expiration of temporary exclusions of central bank reserves, share repurchases, and increased goodwill and intangibles from the Cowen acquisition. This was partially offset by organic capital growth and share issuance through the dividend reinvestment plan.\n\n2. **Capital Management**: Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital was $82.3 billion, with earnings being the main contributor to its growth. The bank issued $1.8 billion in common shares and repurchased $4.3 billion worth of shares. Tier 1 Capital was $92.8 billion, and Tier 2 Capital was $10.9 billion, with notable redemptions of capital instruments.\n\n3. **Dividend and Share Repurchase**: The board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.02 per share for January 2024, up from $0.96. Total dividends for the year were $3.84 per share, with a payout ratio of 48%. The bank repurchased 52 million common shares under its normal course issuer bids (NCIBs).\n\n4. **Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)**: Total RWA increased to $571.2 billion from $517 billion in 2022, with significant increases in credit risk, particularly in retail and corporate exposures. Market risk decreased, while operational risk increased.\n\n5. **Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)**: The bank's ICAAP ensures capital adequacy by relating risks to capital requirements through capital modeling and stress testing, assessing the bank's capacity to bear risk in line with its risk profile.\n\nOverall, the report reflects TD Bank's strategic capital management, including share repurchases and dividend policies, alongside a comprehensive risk management framework to maintain capital adequacy."

For NVCC subordinated notes and debentures, if an NVCC trigger event were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there is no accrued and unpaid interest on the respective subordinated notes and debentures, would be 2.7 billion in aggregate. Future Regulatory Capital Developments On January 31, 2022, OSFI announced revised capital, leverage, liquidity and disclosure rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. Capital revisions pertaining to the calculation of credit risk and operational risk were implemented on February 1, 2023. Revisions pertaining to market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk are effective November 1, 2023. On November 7, 2022, OSFI announced a new Assurance on Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Returns guideline. This guideline lays out OSFI’s approach to enhancing and aligning assurance expectations over capital, leverage and liquidity returns, including an external audit opinion on the numerator and denominator of key regulatory ratios, senior management attestation on regulatory returns, and an internal audit opinion on the processes and controls followed in preparing these returns. The assurance requirements for D-SIBs’ capital, liquidity and leverage returns for internal audit commenced in fiscal 2023; the internal review and senior management attestation requirements commence in fiscal 2024; and the external audit assurance requirements commence in fiscal 2025. On June 20, 2023, OSFI raised the DSB by 50 bps to 3.5% of total RWA, effective November 1, 2023. As a result, the regulatory capital target for CET1, Tier 1 Capital, and Total Capital will increase to 11.5%,13%, and 15%, respectively. On September 12, 2023 OSFI published the final Parental Stand-Alone (Solo) TLAC Framework for D-SIBs. The purpose of the Solo TLAC framework is to ensure a non-viable D-SIB has sufficient loss absorbing capacity on a stand-alone, or solo, legal entity basis to support its resolution. D-SIBs are required to maintain a minimum Solo TLAC ratio of 21.5%, effective November 1, 2023. On October 20, 2023, OSFI released revisions to the Capital Adequacy Requirements Guideline. The update includes requirements to address risks associated with negatively amortizing mortgages, where payments are not sufficient to cover the interest portion of the loans, among other clarifications to the Guideline. This change is effective November 1, 2023.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report provides detailed insights into its equity and other securities as of October 31, 2023. The report highlights a slight decrease in common shares outstanding from 1,821.7 million in 2022 to 1,791.4 million in 2023, with a corresponding increase in their value from CAD 24,363 million to CAD 25,434 million. Preferred shares and other equity instruments also saw a reduction in total value from CAD 11,246 million in 2022 to CAD 10,788 million in 2023, partly due to the redemption of Series 20 Preferred Shares. The report discusses the Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC) provisions, which could result in the issuance of up to 4.8 billion common shares in the event of a trigger. Regulatory updates include the implementation of Basel III reforms, with changes to capital, leverage, and liquidity rules, and the introduction of new assurance guidelines by OSFI. The Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) was increased to 3.5% of total risk-weighted assets, and a new Solo TLAC framework was introduced, requiring D-SIBs to maintain a minimum ratio of 21.5%. Additionally, revisions to the Capital Adequacy Requirements Guideline address risks associated with negatively amortizing mortgages. These regulatory changes are effective from November 1, 2023."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 73 Global Systemically Important Banks Designation and Disclosures The Financial Stability Board (FSB), in consultation with the BCBS and national authorities, identifies G-SIBs. The G-SIB assessment methodology is based on the submissions of the largest global banks. T welve indicators are used in the G-SIB assessment methodology to determine systemic importance. The score for a particular indicator is calculated by dividing the individual bank value by the aggregate amount for the indicator summed across all banks included in the assessment. Accordingly, an individual bank’s ranking is reliant on the results and submissions of other global banks. The Bank is required to publish the twelve indicators used in the G-SIB indicator-based assessment framework. Public disclosur e of financial year-end data is required annually, no later than the date of a bank’s first quarter public disclosure of shareholder financial data in the following year. Public communications on G-SIB status are issued annually each November . On November 22, 2019, the Bank was designated as a G-SIB by the FSB. The Bank continued to maintain its G-SIB status when the FSB published the 2022 list of G-SIBs on November 21, 2022. As a result of this designation, the Bank is subject to an additional loss absorbency requirement (CET1 as a percentage of RWA) of 1% under applicable FSB member authority requirements; however, in accordance with OSFI’s CAR guideline, for Canadian banks designated as a G-SIB, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply. As the D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the incremental 1% G-SIB common equity ratio requirement, the Bank’s G-SIB designation has no additional impact on the Bank’s minimum CET1 regulatory requirements. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%. As a result of the Bank’s G-SIB designation, the U.S. Federal Reserve r equires TD Group US Holding LLC (TDGUS), as TD’s U.S. Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC and long-term debt. Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of operations, the Bank engages in a variety of financial transactions that, under IFRS, are either not recorded on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet or are recorded in amounts that differ from the full contract or notional amounts. These off-balance sheet arrangements involve, among other risks, varying elements of market, credit, and liquidity risks which are discussed in the “Managing Risk” section of this document. Off-balance sheet arrangements are generally undertaken for risk management, capital management, and funding management purposes and include securitizations, contractual obligations, and certain commitments and guarantees. TD carries out certain business activities through arrangements with structur ed entities (SEs). The Bank uses SEs to raise capital, obtain sources of liquidity by securitizing certain of the Bank’s financial assets, to assist TD’s clients in securitizing their financial assets, and to create investment products for the Bank’s clients. Securitizations are an important part of the financial markets, providing liquidity by facilitating investor access to specific portfolios of assets and risks. Refer to Notes 2, 9, and 10 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bank’s involvement with SEs. Securitization of Bank-Originated Assets The Bank securitizes residential mortgages, credit card loans, and business and gover nment loans to enhance its liquidity position, to diversify sources of funding, and to optimize the management of the balance sheet. The Bank securitizes residential mortgages under the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA MBS) pr ogram sponsored by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). The securitization of the residential mortgages with the CMHC does not qualify for derecognition and the mortgages remain on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, the Bank securitizes credit card loans by selling them to Bank-sponsored SEs that are consolidated by the Bank. The Bank also securitizes U.S. residential mortgages with U.S. government- sponsored entities which qualify for derecognition and are removed from the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to Notes 9 and 10 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Residential Mortgage Loans The Bank securitizes residential mortgage loans through significant unconsolidated SEs and Canadian non-SE thir d parties. Residential mortgage loans securitized by the Bank may give rise to full derecognition of the financial assets depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In instances where the Bank fully derecognizes residential mortgage loans, the Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through retained interests. As at October 31, 2023, there were $21.0 billion of securitized residential mortgage loans outstanding through significant unconsolidated SEs (October 31, 2022 – $21.8 billion), and $3.5 billion outstanding thr ough non-SE third parties (October 31, 2022 – $0.9 billion). Credit Card Loans The Bank securitizes credit card loans through an SE. The Bank consolidates the SE as it serves as a financing vehicle for the Bank’ s assets, the Bank has power over the key economic decisions of the SE, and the Bank is exposed to the majority of the residual risks of the SE. As at October 31, 2023, the Bank had $1.5 billion of securitized credit card receivables outstanding (October 31, 2022 – $1.7 billion). Due to the nature of the credit card receivables, their carrying amounts approximate fair value. Business and Government Loans The Bank securitizes business and government loans through Canadian non-SE thir d parties. Business and government loans securitized by the Bank may be derecognized from the Bank’s balance sheet depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In instances where the Bank fully derecognizes business and government loans, the Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through retained interests. There are no ECLs on the retained interests of the securitized business and government loans as the loans are all government insured. As at October 31, 2023, the Bank had $401 million of securitized business and government loans outstanding (October 31, 2022 – $591 million), with carrying value of retained interests of $3 million (October 31, 2022 – $5 million). Securitization of Third-Party Originated Assets Significant Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities Multi-Seller Conduits The Bank securitizes third party-originated assets through Bank- sponsor ed SEs, including its Canadian multi-seller conduits which are not consolidated. These Canadian multi-seller conduits securitize Canadian originated third-party assets. The Bank administers multi-seller conduits and provides liquidity facilities as well as securities distribution services; it may also provide credit enhancements. TD’s maximum potential exposure to loss due to its ownership interest in commercial paper and through the provision of liquidity facilities for multi-seller conduits was $13.3 billion as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $10.8 billion). In addition, as at October 31, 2023, the Bank had committed to provide an additional $1.9 billion in liquidity facilities that can be used to support future asset- backed commercial paper (ABCP) in the purchase of deal-specific assets (October 31, 2022 – $2.1 billion).",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights its designation as a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) by the Financial Stability Board, which requires it to maintain an additional 1% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio. This designation does not currently impact TD's minimum CET1 requirements due to equivalent domestic surcharges. The report also details TD's off-balance sheet activities, including securitization of residential mortgages, credit card loans, and business and government loans to enhance liquidity and manage risk. The bank uses structured entities for these activities, with some assets remaining on the balance sheet while others are derecognized. As of October 31, 2023, TD had significant securitized assets, including $21 billion in residential mortgages and $1.5 billion in credit card receivables. Additionally, TD is involved in securitizing third-party assets through multi-seller conduits, with a potential exposure of $13.3 billion and additional liquidity commitments of $1.9 billion."

As at October 31, 2023, the Bank held $2.2 billion of ABCP issued by Bank-sponsored multi-seller conduits within the Trading loans, securities, and other category on its 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet (October 31, 2022 – $1.8 billion). OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURE TO THIRD-PARTY The Bank has off-balance sheet exposure to third-party sponsored conduits arising fr om providing liquidity facilities and funding commitments of $4.7 billion as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $3.1 billion). The assets within these conduits are comprised of individual notes backed by automotive loan receivables, credit card receivables, equipment receivables and trade receivables. On-balance sheet exposure to third-party sponsored conduits have been included in the financial statements. The Bank enters into various commitments to meet the financing needs of the Bank’ s clients, to earn fee income, and to lease premises and equipment. Significant commitments of the Bank include financial and performance standby letters of cr edit, documentary and commercial letters of credit, commitments to extend credit, and obligations under long- term non-cancellable leases for premises and equipment. These products may expose the Bank to liquidity, credit, and reputational risks. There are adequate risk management and control processes in place to mitigate these risks. Certain commitments still remain off-balance sheet. Note 26 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements provides detailed information about the Bank’s commitments including credit-related arrangements and long-term commitments or leases. In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various guarantee contracts to support its clients. The Bank’ s significant types of guarantee products are financial and performance standby letters of credit, credit enhancements, and indemnification agreements. Certain guarantees remain off-balance sheet. Refer to Note 26 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Related Party Transactions TRANSACTIONS WITH KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, THEIR CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS, AND THEIR RELATED ENTITIES Key management personnel are those persons having authority and r esponsibility for planning, directing, and controlling the activities of the Bank, directly or indirectly. The Bank considers certain of its officers and directors to be key management personnel. The Bank makes loans to its key management personnel, their close family members, and their related entities on market terms and conditions with the exception of banking products and services for key management personnel, which are subject to approved policy guidelines that govern all employees. In addition, the Bank offers deferred share and other plans to non- employee dir ectors, executives, and certain other key employees. Refer to Note 22 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank also provides various banking services to associated and other r elated corporations on terms similar to those offered to non-related parties. TRANSACTIONS WITH SUBSIDIARIES, SCHWAB, AND SYMCOR INC. Transactions between the Bank and its subsidiaries meet the definition of r elated party transactions. If these transactions are eliminated on consolidation, they are not disclosed as related party transactions. Transactions between the Bank, Schwab, and Symcor Inc. (Symcor) also qualify as r elated party transactions. There were no significant transactions between the Bank, Schwab, and Symcor during the year ended October 31, 2023, other than as described in the following sections and in Note 12 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. i) TRANSACTIONS WITH SCHWAB The Bank has significant influence over Schwab and accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. Pursuant to the Stockholder Agr eement in relation to the Bank’s equity investment in Schwab, subject to certain conditions, the Bank has the right to designate two members of Schwab’s Board of Directors and has representation on two Board Committees. As of October 31, 2023, the Bank’s designated directors were the Bank’s Group President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank’s Chair of the Board. A description of significant transactions between the Bank and its affiliates with Schwab is set forth below .",

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 75 Insured Deposit Account Agreement On November 25, 2019, the Bank and Schwab signed the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, with an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. Under the 2019 Schwab IDA Agr eement, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into the 2023 Schwab IDA Agr eement, which replaced the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement. Pursuant to the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank continues to make sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Schwab designates a portion of the deposits with the Bank as FROA. Remaining deposits over the minimum level of FROA are designated as floating-rate obligations. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by three years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until September 2025, the aggregate FROA will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to $6.8 billion (US$5 billion) of FROA by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to certain limits. During the year ended October 31, 2023, Schwab exercised its option to buy down $6.1 billion (US$4.5 billion) of FROA and paid $305 million (US$227 million) in termination fees to the Bank in accor dance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement. The fees are intended to compensate the Bank for losses incurred this year from discontinuing certain hedging relationships, as well as for lost revenues. The net impact is recorded in net inter est income. As at October 31, 2023, deposits under the Schwab IDA Agreement wer e $133 billion (US$96 billion) (October 31, 2022 – $174 billion (US$128 billion)). The Bank paid fees, net of the termination fees received from Schwab, of $932 million during the year ended October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $1.7 billion) to Schwab related to sweep deposit accounts. The amount paid by the Bank is based on the average insured deposit balance of $147 billion for the year ended October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $182 billion) and yields based on agreed upon market benchmarks, less the actual interest paid to clients of Schwab. As at October 31, 2023, amounts receivable from Schwab were $38 million (October 31, 2022 – $31 million). As at October 31, 2023, amounts payable to Schwab wer e $24 million (October 31, 2022 – $152 million). ii) TRANSACTIONS WITH SYMCOR The Bank has one-third ownership in Symcor, a Canadian provider of business pr ocess outsourcing services offering a diverse portfolio of integrated solutions in item processing, statement processing and production, and cash management services. The Bank accounts for Symcor’s results using the equity method of accounting. During the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank paid $81 million (October 31, 2022 – $77 million) for these services. As at October 31, 2023, the amount payable to Symcor was $12 million (October 31, 2022 – $12 million). The Bank and two other shareholder banks have also provided a $100 million unsecur ed loan facility to Symcor which was undrawn as at October 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022. Financial Instruments As a financial institution, the Bank’s assets and liabilities are substantially composed of financial instruments. Financial assets of the Bank include, but are not limited to, cash, interest-bearing deposits, securities, loans, derivative instruments and securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements; while financial liabilities include, but are not limited to, deposits, obligations related to securities sold short, securitization liabilities, obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, derivative instruments, and subordinated debt. The Bank uses financial instruments for both trading and non-trading activities. The Bank typically engages in trading activities by the pur chase and sale of securities to provide liquidity and meet the needs of clients and, less frequently, by taking trading positions with the objective of earning a profit. Trading financial instruments include, but are not limited to, trading securities, trading deposits, and trading derivatives. Non- trading financial instruments include the majority of the Bank’s lending portfolio, non-trading securities, hedging derivatives, and the majority of the Bank’s financial liabilities. In accordance with accounting standards related to financial instruments, financial assets or liabilities classified as held-for -trading, non-trading FVTPL, designated at FVTPL, FVOCI, and all derivatives are measured at fair value in the Bank’s 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. DSAC, most loans, and other liabilities are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. For details on how fair values of financial instruments are determined, refer to the “Accounting Judgments, Estimates, and Assumptions” – “Fair Value Measurement” section of this document. The use of financial instruments allows the Bank to earn profits in trading, interest, and fee income. Financial instruments also create a variety of risks which the Bank manages with its extensive risk management policies and procedures. The key risks include interest rate, credit, liquidity, market, and foreign exchange risks. For a more detailed description on how the Bank manages its risk, refer to the “Managing Risk” section of this document.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key financial activities and agreements. The Bank and Schwab entered into a new Insured Deposit Account (IDA) Agreement in 2023, replacing the 2019 agreement. This new agreement extends the expiration date to 2034 and adjusts deposit balance requirements, with lower balances initially and higher ones later. Schwab exercised an option to reduce its Fixed Rate Obligations (FROA) by $6.1 billion, paying $305 million in termination fees to TD Bank. As of October 31, 2023, deposits under the Schwab IDA Agreement were $133 billion, down from $174 billion the previous year. The Bank paid Schwab $932 million in fees related to sweep deposit accounts, based on an average insured deposit balance of $147 billion.\n\nAdditionally, TD Bank has a one-third ownership in Symcor, a Canadian business process outsourcing provider, and paid $81 million for services in 2023. The Bank, along with two other shareholder banks, has provided a $100 million undrawn loan facility to Symcor.\n\nThe report also discusses the Bank's use of financial instruments for trading and non-trading activities, which are crucial for liquidity, client needs, and profit generation. These instruments are subject to various risks, including interest rate, credit, liquidity, market, and foreign exchange risks, which the Bank manages through comprehensive risk management policies."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS76 Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results In addition to the risks described in the “Managing Risk” section, there are numerous other risk factors, many of which are beyond the Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, that could cause the Bank’s results to differ significantly from the Bank’s plans, objectives, and estimates or could impact the Bank’s reputation or sustainability of its business model. All forward-looking statements, including those in this MD&A, are, by their very nature, subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific, which may cause the Bank’s actual results to differ materially from the plan, objectives, estimates or expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Some of these factors are discussed below and others are noted in the “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section of this document. The Bank considers it critical to regularly assess its operating environment and highlight top and emerging risks. These are risks with a potential to have a material effect on the Bank and where the attention of senior management is focused due to the potential magnitude or immediacy of their impacts. Risks are identified, discussed, and actioned by senior management and reported quarterly to the Risk Committee and the Board. Specific plans to mitigate top and emerging risks are prepared, monitored, and adjusted as required. General Business and Economic Conditions The Bank and its customers operate in Canada, the U.S., and, to a lesser extent, in other countries. As a result, the Bank’s earnings are significantly affected by the general business and economic conditions in these regions, which could have an adverse impact on the Bank’s results, business, financial condition or liquidity, and could result in changes to the way the Bank operates. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, the decline in economic activity that could lead to a recession, volatility in financial markets, and related market liquidity, funding costs, real estate prices, employment levels, consumer spending and debt levels, evolving consumer trends and related changes to business models, business investment and overall business sentiment, government policy including levels of government spending, monetary policy, fiscal policy (including tax policy and rate changes), exchange rates, sovereign debt risks. Geopolitical Risk Government policy, international trade and political relations across the globe may impact overall market and economic stability, including in the regions where the Bank operates, or where its customers operate. While the nature and extent of risks may vary, they have the potential to disrupt global economic growth, create volatility in financial markets that may affect the Bank’s trading and non-trading activities, market liquidity, funding costs, interest rates, foreign exchange, commodity prices, credit spreads, fiscal policy, and directly and indirectly influence general business and economic conditions in ways that may have an adverse impact on the Bank and its customers. Geopolitical risks in 2023 included ongoing global tensions resulting in sanctions and countersanctions and related operational complexities, supply chain disruptions, being subjected to heightened regulatory focus on climate change and transition to a low-carbon economy, increased likelihood of critical public and private infrastructure and networks to cyber-attacks, the Russia/Ukraine war, and the resulting tensions between Russia and other nation states, social unrest in the Middle East that have escalated due to the Israel/Hamas war, political and economic turmoil, threats of terrorism and ongoing protectionism measures due to a decline in global alignment. Inflation, Rising Rates, and Recession Interest rates are expected to remain at elevated levels and potentially increase further as central banks continue their efforts to manage inflation to target levels. Elevated interest rates and other macroeconomic conditions could have adverse impacts on the Bank’s cost of funding, result in increased loan delinquencies or impairments and higher credit losses due to deterioration in the financial condition of the Bank’s customers and may necessitate further increases in the Bank’s provision for credit losses and net charge offs, all of which could negatively impact the Bank’s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. In addition, actual stress levels experienced by the Bank’s borrowers may differ from assumptions incorporated in estimates or models used by the Bank. The elevated rate environment also increases concerns around the probability of a recession in Canada, the U.S. and other regions where the Bank and its customers operate and continues to impact the macroeconomic and business environment. Such developments could have an adverse impact on the Bank’s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Regulatory Oversight and Compliance Risk The Bank and its businesses are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by a number of different governments, regulators and self- regulatory organizations (collectively, “Bank regulators”) around the world. Regulatory and legislative changes and changes in Bank regulators’ expectations occur in all jurisdictions in which the Bank operates. Bank regulators around the world have demonstrated an increased focus on capital and liquidity risk management; consumer protection; data control, use and security; conduct risk and internal risk and control frameworks across the three lines of defence; and money laundering, terrorist financing and economic sanctions risks and threats. There is heightened scrutiny by Bank regulators globally on the impact of rising interest rates and inflation on customers, as well as on the Bank’s operations and its management and oversight of risks associated with these matters. In addition, these risks continue to rapidly evolve, as a result of new or emerging threats, including geopolitical and those associated with use of new, emerging and interrelated technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, models and decision-making tools. The content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial services firms may sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in Canada, the United States and other countries and regions in which the Bank does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements. Furthermore, some of the Bank’s regulators have the discretion to impose additional standards or guidance regarding the Bank’s risk, capital and liquidity management, or other matters within their regulatory scope, and in some cases the Bank may be prohibited by law from publicly disclosing such additional standards or guidance. The Bank monitors and evaluates the potential impact of applicable regulatory developments (including enacted and proposed rules, standards, public enforcement actions, consent orders, and regulatory guidance). However, while the Bank devotes substantial compliance, legal, and operational business resources to facilitate compliance with these developments by their respective effective dates, and also to the consideration of other Bank regulator expectations, it is possible that: (i) the Bank may not be able to accurately predict the impact of regulatory",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several risk factors that could significantly impact the bank's future results, reputation, and business sustainability. These risks include general business and economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, inflation, rising interest rates, and potential recessions in key markets like Canada and the U.S. The report emphasizes the challenges posed by regulatory oversight and compliance, noting the extensive regulation by various global authorities and the evolving nature of regulatory expectations. The bank is particularly focused on managing risks related to capital and liquidity, consumer protection, data security, and the impacts of new technologies. The report underscores the importance of regular risk assessment and the development of mitigation strategies to address these top and emerging risks."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS77 developments, or the interpretation or focus of enforcement actions taken by governments, regulators and courts, (ii) the Bank may not be able to develop or enhance the platforms, technology, or operational procedures and frameworks necessary to comply with, or adapt to, such rules or expectations in advance of their effective dates; or (iii) regulators and other parties could challenge the Bank’s compliance. Also, it may be determined that the Bank has not adequately, completely or timely addressed regulatory developments or other regulatory actions, such as enforcement actions, to which it is subject, in a manner which meets Bank regulator expectations. The Bank has been subject to regulatory enforcement proceedings and has entered into settlement arrangements with Bank regulators, and the Bank may continue to face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation. This could require the Bank to take further actions or incur more costs than expected and may expose the Bank to litigation, enforcement and reputational risk. Regulatory and legislative changes and changes in expectations will continue to increase the Bank’s compliance and operational risks and costs. In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives could require the Bank to make significant modifications to its operations in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. This could result in increased costs as well as adversely affect the Bank’s businesses and results of operations. Furthermore, if governments or regulators take formal enforcement action against the Bank, the Bank’s operations, business strategies and product and service offerings may be adversely impacted, therefore impacting financial results. The Bank may incur greater than expected costs associated with enhancing its compliance, or may incur fines, penalties or judgments not in its favour associated with non-compliance, all of which could also lead to negative impacts on the Bank’s financial performance, operational changes including restrictions on offering certain products or services or on operating in certain jurisdictions, and its reputation. Executing on Long-Term Strategies, Shorter-Term Key Strategic Priorities, Acquisitions and Investments The Bank has a number of strategies and priorities, including those detailed in each Segment’s “Business Segment Analysis” section of this document, which may include large scale strategic or regulatory initiatives that are at various stages of development or implementation. Examples include organic growth strategies; integrating recently acquired businesses (e.g., Cowen); projects to meet new regulatory requirements; building new platforms, technology, and omnichannel capabilities; and enhancements to existing technology. Risk can be elevated due to the size, scope, velocity, interdependency, and complexity of projects; limited timeframes to complete projects; and competing priorities for limited specialized resources. The Bank regularly explores opportunities to acquire companies or businesses, directly or indirectly, through the acquisition strategies of its subsidiaries. In respect of acquisitions, the Bank undertakes transaction assessments and due diligence before completing a merger or an acquisition, ensures the transaction fits within the Bank’s Risk Appetite, and closely monitors integration activities and performance post acquisition close. However, the Bank’s ability to successfully complete an acquisition is often subject to regulatory and other approvals, and the Bank cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required approvals will be granted. While there is significant management attention on the governance, oversight, methodology, tools, and resources needed to manage the Bank’s strategies and priorities, the Bank’s ability to execute on them is dependent on a number of assumptions and factors. These include those set out in the “Economic Summary and Outlook”, “Key Priorities for 2024”, “2023 Accomplishments and Focus for 2024”, “Operating Environment and Outlook”, and “Managing Risk” sections of this document, as well as disciplined resource and expense management and the Bank’s ability to implement (and the costs associated with the implementation of) enterprise-wide programs to comply with new or enhanced regulations or regulator demands, all of which may not be in the Bank’s control and are difficult to predict. The Bank may not achieve its financial or strategic objectives, including anticipated cost savings or revenue synergies, following acquisition and integration activities. In addition, from time to time, the Bank may invest in companies without taking a controlling position in those companies, which may subject the Bank to the operating and financial risks of those companies, the risk that these companies may make decisions that the Bank does not agree with, and the risk that the Bank may have differing objectives than the companies in which the Bank has interests. As at October 31, 2023, the Bank’s reported investment in Schwab was approximately 12.4% of the outstanding voting and non-voting common shares of Schwab, and the Bank is not permitted to own more than 9.9% of the voting common shares of Schwab. The value of the Bank’s investment in Schwab and its contribution to the Bank’s financial results are vulnerable to poor financial performance or other issues at Schwab affecting its business. In addition, the Bank may be affected by actions taken by Schwab, or if Schwab does not perform its obligations, pursuant to the Schwab IDA agreement (as further described in the “Related Party Transactions” section of this document). Further, the Bank relies on Schwab for its financial results that are included in the Bank’s financial statements. Although the Bank has director designation rights to the Schwab board of directors and certain other rights under the Stockholder Agreement with Schwab so long as it holds at least a 5% equity interest in Schwab (and currently has designated two directors to serve on the Schwab board), these rights may not mitigate the Bank’s exposure to poor financial performance or other issues at Schwab that may affect the Bank’s financial results. If any of the Bank’s strategies, priorities, acquisition and integration activities or investments are not successfully executed, or do not achieve their financial or strategic objectives, there may be an impact on the Bank’s operations and financial performance and the Bank’s earnings could grow more slowly or decline. Technology and Cyber Security Risk Technology and cyber security risks for large financial institutions like the Bank have increased in recent years, especially due to heightened geopolitical tensions that increase the risk of cyber-attacks. The rising likelihood of attacks on critical infrastructure and supply chains is due, in part, to the proliferation, sophistication and constant evolution of new technologies and attack methodologies used by threat actors, such as organized criminals, nation states, sociopolitical entities and other internal and external parties. The heightened risks are also a result of the Bank’s size and scale of operations, geographic footprint, the complexity of its technology infrastructure, its increasing reliance on internet capabilities, cloud and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, such as its continued development of mobile and internet banking platforms as well as opportunistic threats by actors that have accelerated exploitations of new weaknesses, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities. The Bank’s technologies, systems and networks, those of the Bank’s customers (including their own devices), and third parties providing services to the Bank, continue to be subject to cyber-attacks, and may be subject to disruption of services, data security or other breaches (such as loss or exposure of confidential information, including customer or employee information), identity theft and corporate espionage, or other compromises. The Bank has experienced service disruptions as a result of technology failure at a third party and may be subject to such disruptions in the future due to cyber-attacks and/or technology failure. The Bank’s use of third-party service providers, which are subject to these potential compromises, increases the risk of potential attack, breach or disruption as the Bank has less immediate oversight and direct control over the third parties’ technology infrastructure or information security.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key challenges and strategic priorities. The bank faces increasing regulatory and compliance risks, which could lead to higher costs, operational changes, and potential reputational damage. It is actively working on long-term strategies, including organic growth, acquisitions, and technology enhancements, but these efforts are complicated by regulatory approvals and integration challenges. The bank's investment in Schwab poses additional financial risks due to potential performance issues at Schwab. Furthermore, technology and cybersecurity risks are escalating, driven by geopolitical tensions and the complexity of the bank's operations. The bank is vulnerable to cyber-attacks and service disruptions, particularly due to its reliance on third-party service providers. Overall, these factors could impact the bank's financial performance and strategic objectives."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS78 Although the Bank has not experienced any material financial losses or non-financial harm relating to technology failure, cyber-attacks, data security or other breaches, the Bank may experience material loss or damage in the future as a result of targeted and automated online attacks on banking systems and applications, supply chain attacks, ransomware attacks, introduction of malicious software, denial of service attacks, malicious insider or service provider exfiltrating data, and phishing attacks, among others. Any of these attacks could result in fraud, disclosure/ theft of data or funds, or the disruption of the Bank’s operations. Cyber- attacks may include attempts by employees, agents or third-party service providers of the Bank to disrupt operations, access or disclose sensitive information or other data of the Bank, its customers or its employees. In addition, attempts to illicitly or misleadingly induce employees, customers, service providers, or other users of the Bank’s systems occur, and will likely continue to occur, in an effort to obtain sensitive information, gain access to the Bank’s or its customers’ or employees’ data or customer or Bank funds, or to disrupt the Bank’s operations. In addition, the Bank’s customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, which limits the Bank’s ability to mitigate certain risks introduced through these personal devices. The Bank regularly reviews external events and assesses and enhances its controls and response capabilities as it considers necessary to mitigate against the risk of cyber-attacks or data security or other breaches, but these activities may not mitigate all risks, and the Bank may experience loss or damage arising from such attacks. Cyber and technology-related risks have become increasingly difficult to mitigate in totality mainly because the tactics, techniques, and procedures used change frequently and risks can originate from a wide variety of sources that have also become increasingly sophisticated. As a result, the industry and the Bank are susceptible to experiencing potential financial and non-financial loss and/or harm from these attacks. The adoption of certain technologies, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and process automation call for continued focus and investment to manage the Bank’s risks effectively. It is possible that the Bank, or those with whom the Bank does business, have not anticipated or implemented, or may not anticipate or implement effective measures against all such cyber and technology-related risks, particularly because the tactics, techniques, and procedures used change frequently and risks can originate from a wide variety of sources that have also become increasingly sophisticated. Furthermore, cyber insurance providers are modifying their terms as a result of increased global cyber activity causing pricing uncertainty and coverage term changes across the industry. This has the potential to impact the Bank’s cyber insurance purchased to mitigate risk and may limit the amount of coverage available for financial losses. As such, with any cyber-attack, disruption of services, data, security or other breaches (including loss or exposure of confidential information), identity theft, corporate espionage or other compromise of technology or information systems, hardware or related processes, or any significant issues caused by weakness in information technology infrastructure and systems, the Bank may experience, among other things, financial loss; a loss of customers or business opportunities; disruption to operations; misappropriation or unauthorized release of confidential, financial or personal information; damage to computers or systems of the Bank and those of its customers and counterparties; violations of applicable privacy and other laws; litigation; regulatory penalties or intervention, remediation, investigation or restoration costs; increased costs to maintain and update the Bank’s operational and security systems and infrastructure; and reputational damage. If the Bank were to experience such an incident, it may take a significant amount of time and resources to investigate the incident to obtain full and reliable information necessary to assess the impact. The Bank’s owned and operated applications, platforms, networks, processes, products, and services could be subject to failures or disruptions as a result of human error, natural disasters, utility or infrastructure disruptions, pandemics or other public health emergencies, malicious insiders or service providers, cyber-attacks or other criminal or terrorist acts, or non-compliance with regulations, which may impact the Bank’s operations. Such adverse effects could limit the Bank’s ability to deliver products and services to customers, and/or damage the Bank’s reputation, which in turn could lead to financial loss. Model Risk Model uncertainty remains due to emerging risks (including high inflation, rising interest rates and prolonged high interest rate environment), with model reliability impacted across some business areas. Although short- and long-term mitigants were identified and executed to help improve resilience of models trained on historical data, that may become less relevant under the current environment (e.g., in the case of IFRS 9 and stress testing models). Management’s efforts to assess and update models may not adequately or successfully improve the resilience of such models. Fraud Activity Fraud risk is the risk associated with acts designed to deceive others, resulting in financial loss and harm to shareholder value, brand, reputation, employee satisfaction and customers. Fraud Risk arises from numerous sources, including potential or existing customers, agents, third parties, contractors, employees and other internal or external parties, including service providers to the Bank’s customers that store bank account credentials and harvest data based on customers’ web banking information and activities. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers or counterparties, the Bank may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of such customers, counterparties or other external parties, including financial statements and financial information and authentication information. The Bank may also rely on the representations of customers, counterparties, and other external parties as to the accuracy and completeness of such information. Misrepresentation of this information potentially exposes the Bank to increased fraud events when transacting with customers or counterparties. In order to authenticate customers, whether through the Bank’s phone or digital channels or in its branches and stores, the Bank may also rely on certain authentication methods which could be subject to fraud. The Bank has continued to see an increase in the volume of fraud attacks through 2023. Fraud attacks have transitioned back to traditional transaction level fraud, and away from attacking COVID-19 government related programs. Attempts to illicitly or misleadingly induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other uses of the Bank’s systems will continue, in an effort to obtain sensitive information and gain access to the Bank’s or its customers’ or employees’ data or customer or Bank funds. Losses attributed to fraud during the 2023 fiscal year increased as a result of several large dollar loss events, perpetrated against the Bank’s deposit channels. Additionally TD, and the industry as a whole, has experienced an increase in attack levels. Despite the Bank’s investments in fraud prevention and detection programs, capabilities, measures and defences, they have not, and in the future may not successfully mitigate against all fraudulent activity which could result in financial loss or disruptions in the Bank’s businesses. In addition to the risk of material loss (financial loss, misappropriation of confidential information or other assets of the Bank or its customers and counterparties) that could result from fraudulent activity, the Bank could face legal action and customer and market confidence in the Bank could be impacted. Insider Risk Insider risk is an increasing risk across all industries that can have significant impact to organizations, including the Bank. The Bank closely monitors the internal threat environment across all typologies (e.g. cyber, third parties, fraud, workplace violence/harassment, etc.) and continues to invest in TD’s insider risk management program. Notwithstanding, the Bank continues to be exposed to adverse regulatory, financial, operational and reputational impacts as a result of insider events. Third-Party Risk The Bank recognizes the value of using third parties to support its businesses, as they provide access to leading applications, processes, products and services, specialized expertise, innovation, economies of scale, and operational efficiencies. However, the Bank may become dependent on third parties with respect to continuity, reliability, and security, and their associated processes, people and facilities. As the financial services industry and its supply chains become more complex, the need for resilient, robust, holistic, and sophisticated controls, and ongoing oversight increases. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS79 The Bank also recognizes that the applications, platforms, networks, processes, products, and services from third parties could be subject to failures or disruptions impacting the delivery of services or products to the Bank. These failures or disruptions could be because of human error, natural disasters, utility or infrastructure disruptions, changes in the financial condition of such third parties, other general business and economic conditions which may impact such third parties, pandemics or other public health emergencies, malicious insiders or service providers, cyber-attacks or other criminal or terrorist acts, or non-compliance with regulations. Such adverse effects could limit the Bank’s ability to deliver products and services to customers, lead to disruptions in the Bank’s businesses, expose the Bank to financial losses that the Bank is unable to recover from such third parties, and expose the Bank to legal and regulatory risks, including those outlined under the headings ‘Regulatory Oversight and Compliance Risk’ and ‘Legal Proceedings’, and/or damage the Bank’s reputation, which in turn could result in an adverse impact to the Bank’s operations, earnings or financial condition. Introduction of New and Changes to Current Laws and Regulations The financial services industry is highly regulated. The Bank’s operations, profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by the introduction of new laws and regulations, amendments to, or changes in interpretation or application of current laws, rules and regulations, issuance of judicial decisions, and changes in enforcement pace or activities. These adverse effects could also result from the fiscal, economic, and monetary policies of various central banks, regulatory agencies, self-regulatory organizations and governments in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and other countries, and changes in the interpretation or implementation of those policies. Such adverse effects may include incurring additional costs and devoting additional resources to address initial and ongoing compliance; limiting the types or nature of products and services the Bank can provide and fees it can charge; unfavourably impacting the pricing and delivery of products and services the Bank provides; increasing the ability of new and existing competitors to compete on the basis of pricing, products and services (including, in jurisdictions outside Canada, the favouring of certain domestic institutions); and increasing risks associated with potential non-compliance. In addition to the adverse impacts described above, the Bank’s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in sanctions, financial and non-financial penalties, and changes including restrictions on offering certain products or services or on operating in certain jurisdictions, that could adversely impact its earnings, operations and reputation. See also the risks described under the heading ‘Regulatory Oversight and Compliance Risk’. Anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and economic sanctions requirements continue to be a high priority globally, with an increasing pace of regulatory change and evolving industry standards in all of the jurisdictions in which the Bank operates. The global data and privacy landscape is dynamic and regulatory expectations continue to evolve. New and amended legislation is anticipated in various jurisdictions in which the Bank does business. Canadian, U.S. and global regulators have been increasingly focused on conduct, operational resilience and consumer protection matters and risks, which could lead to investigations, remediation requirements, and higher compliance costs. While the Bank takes numerous steps to continue to strengthen its conduct programs and its operational resilience, and prevent and detect outcomes which could potentially harm customers, colleagues or the integrity of the markets, such outcomes may not always be prevented or detected. Regulators have increased their focus on ESG matters, including the impact of climate change, greenwashing, sustainable finance, financial and economic inclusion and ESG-related policies and disclosure regarding such matters, with significant new legislation and amended legislation anticipated in some of the jurisdictions in which the Bank does business. In addition, there may be changes in interpretation or application of current laws and regulations to incorporate ESG matters in ways that were not previously anticipated. Despite the Bank’s monitoring and evaluation of the potential impact of rules, proposals, public enforcement actions, consent orders and regulatory guidance, unanticipated new regulations or regulatory interpretations applicable to the Bank may be introduced by governments and regulators around the world and the issuance of judicial decisions may result in unanticipated consequences to the Bank. Canada The Canadian Securities Administrators have passed regulations with operational impacts related to shortening the Canadian trade settlement cycle from T+2 to T+1 to align with U.S. trade settlement and enhanced client reporting of fund expenses, amongst others. The Bank is taking steps to implement those regulations and is monitoring other regulatory initiatives, all of which, when implemented, could result in increased compliance costs that may impact the Bank’s businesses, operations and results. In Canada, there are a number of government and regulatory initiatives underway that could impact financial institutions, including OSFI’s expanded mandate, new Supervisory Framework, and initiatives with respect to payments evolution and modernization, open banking, consumer protection, protection of customer data, technology and cyber security, climate risk management and disclosure, dealing with vulnerable persons, and anti-money laundering. For example, OSFI released a guideline related to technology and cyber risk management, which will come into effect in 2024, and will require the Bank to assess its governance and risk management framework, technology operations and resilience, and cyber-security strategies and frameworks, and make any necessary changes to mitigate technology and cyber risks in compliance with the guideline, all of which could result in increased compliance costs and impact the Bank’s organizational plans, policies, processes and standards. United States In July 2023, the U.S. banking regulators proposed regulations modifying U.S. capital rules to effectuate the Basel III standards (as well as other changes), with phased implementation targeted to begin in July 2025. The proposed rule is expected to increase capital requirements on large banks with more than US$100 billion in total assets. The Federal Reserve estimates relative capital requirements would increase approximately 14% for the intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations. These changes would impact the Bank’s intermediate holding company and subsidiaries but would not have a direct impact on the Bank’s CET1 ratios, which are based on OFSI rules. The proposed rule would eliminate the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income opt-out following a three- year transition period, which would require reflecting unrealized losses and gains from Available-for-sale securities in regulatory capital. In addition, the Federal Reserve has, as part of a separate proposed rule on a G-SIB surcharge, proposed changes to the definition of the “cross- jurisdictional activity” risk-based indicator. The proposed change would include cross-jurisdictional derivatives exposures (which are currently excluded) in the calculation of cross-jurisdictional activity. The Federal Reserve estimates that this change in approach would substantially increase the reported value of cross-jurisdictional activity in the combined U.S. operations (CUSO) and intermediate holding companies of foreign banking organizations. Exceeding US$75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity would result in treatment as a “Category II” institution under the Federal Reserve’s regulatory framework. The Federal Reserve expects seven large foreign banking organizations would move into Category II based on this change in approach, and it is likely that the Bank would be impacted. These proposed rules are at an early stage of the rule-making process. There may be changes made to the proposal before the rules are finalized and it is unclear what the substance of the final rules, the timing on finalization of the rules, and the time frame for compliance, will be. It is likely that the Bank will incur operational, capital, liquidity and compliance costs resulting from the changes in these rules.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key risks and challenges facing the bank. Despite not experiencing significant financial losses from technology failures or cyber-attacks, the bank acknowledges the potential for future material losses due to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, including ransomware, phishing, and insider threats. The bank is investing in technology and security measures, but acknowledges that these may not fully mitigate all risks. Fraud risk has increased, with a shift back to traditional transaction-level fraud, leading to significant financial losses. Insider risk and third-party dependencies also pose challenges, with potential impacts on operations and reputation. Regulatory changes, particularly in Canada and the U.S., could increase compliance costs and operational challenges. The bank is preparing for new regulations, including those related to technology, cybersecurity, and ESG matters, which could further impact its operations and financial condition."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS80 The current U.S. regulatory environment for banking organizations may be further impacted by additional legislative or regulatory developments, including resulting from changes in U.S. executive administration, congressional leadership and/or agency leadership, and regulators focusing on potential racial discrimination and economic inequity, including fair lending and unfair, deceptive, or abuse acts or practices. The U.S. banking regulators will likely pursue further changes to the regulation and supervision of banks in response to bank failures in Spring 2023 and have identified changes to liquidity, interest rate risk and incentive compensation as areas of focus. The ultimate outcome of these developments and their impact on the Bank remain uncertain. Europe In Europe, there remain a number of uncertainties in connection with the future of the United Kingdom – European Union relationship, and reforms implemented through the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and the review of Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and accompanying Regulation could result in higher operational and system costs and potential changes in the types of products and services the Bank can offer to customers in the region. Level of Competition, Shifts in Consumer Attitudes, and Disruptive Technology The Bank operates in a highly competitive industry and its performance is impacted by the level of competition. Customer retention and acquisition can be influenced by many factors, including the Bank’s reputation as well as the pricing, market differentiation, and overall customer experience of the Bank’s products and services. Enhanced competition from incumbents and new entrants may impact the Bank’s pricing of products and services and may cause it to lose revenue and/or market share. Increased competition requires the Bank to make additional short and long-term investments to remain competitive and continue delivering differentiated value to its customers. In addition, the Bank operates in environments where laws and regulations that apply to it may not universally apply to its current and emerging competitors, which could include the domestic institutions in jurisdictions outside of Canada or the U.S., or non-traditional providers (such as Fintech or big technology competitors) of financial products and services. Non-depository or non-financial institutions are often able to offer products and services that were traditionally banking products and compete with banks in offering digital financial solutions (primarily mobile or web-based services), without facing the same regulatory requirements or oversight. These competitors may also operate at much lower costs relative to revenue or balances than traditional banks or offer financial services at a loss to drive user growth or to support their other profitable businesses. These third parties can seek to acquire customer relationships, react quickly to changes in consumer behaviours, and disintermediate customers from their primary financial institution, which can also increase fraud and privacy risks for customers and financial institutions in general. The nature of disruption is such that it can be difficult to anticipate and/or respond to adequately or quickly, representing inherent risks to certain Bank businesses, including payments. As such, this type of competition could also adversely impact the Bank’s earnings. The Bank is advancing its artificial intelligence (AI) practice and capabilities to augment the Bank’s business decisions and risk management, improve customer experiences and drive operational efficiencies. This includes studying generative AI, which has garnered significant public attention and is already demonstrating the potential to further enhance customer experience and outcomes for the Bank; however, all forms of AI may not appropriately or sufficiently replicate certain outcomes or accurately predict future events or exposures. While TD pursues a comprehensive enterprise innovation approach including colleague ideation, an incubator in TD Lab, acceleration activities in agile pods, a patent portfolio, a human centered design practice and certain relationships with Big Tech and Fin Tech, the Bank still may not be able to remain competitive and deliver differentiated value to its customers. In turn, this could adversely impact the Bank’s earnings. Environmental and Social Risk (including Climate Risk) As a financial institution, the Bank is subject to environmental and social (E&S) risk. Environmental risk is the risk of financial loss, harm, or reputational damage resulting from environmental factors, including climate change and nature loss (e.g., loss of biodiversity and deforestation). Climate risk is the risk of reputational damage and/or financial loss arising from materialized credit, market, operational or other risks resulting from the physical and transition risks of climate change to the Bank, its clients, or the communities the Bank operates in. This includes physical risks arising from the consequences of a changing climate, including acute physical risks stemming from extreme weather events happening with increasing severity and frequency (e.g., wildfires, heat waves, and floods) and chronic physical risks stemming from longer-term, progressive shifts in climatic and environmental conditions (e.g., rising sea levels and global warming). Transition risks arise from the process of shifting to a low- carbon economy, influenced by new and emerging climate-related public policies and regulations, changing societal demands and preferences, technologies, stakeholder expectations, and legal developments. Social risk is the risk of financial loss, harm, or reputational damage resulting from social factors, including human rights (e.g., discrimination, Indigenous Peoples’ rights, modern slavery, and human trafficking), the social impacts of climate change (e.g., poverty, health, and economic and physical displacement) and the health and wellbeing of employees (e.g., inclusion and diversity, pay equity, mental health, physical wellbeing, and workplace safety). Organizations, including the Bank, are under increasing scrutiny to address social and financial inequalities among racialized and other marginalized groups and are subject to rules and regulations both locally and internationally. E&S risk is a transverse risk and implicates all of the Bank’s Major Risk Categories. Drivers of E&S risk are often multi-faceted and can originate from the Bank’s internal environment, including its operations, business activities, E&S-related targets, commitments and disclosure, products, clients, colleagues, or suppliers. Drivers of E&S risk can also originate from the Bank’s external environment, including the communities in which the Bank operates, as well as second-order impacts of physical risks and the transition to a low-carbon economy. E&S risks may have financial, reputational, and/or other implications for both the Bank and its stakeholders (including its customers, suppliers, and shareholders) over a range of timeframes. These risks may arise from the Bank’s actual or perceived actions, or inaction, in relation to climate change and other E&S issues, its progress against its E&S targets or commitments, or its disclosures on these matters. These risks could also result from E&S matters impacting the Bank’s stakeholders. The Bank’s participation in external E&S-related organizations or commitments may exacerbate these risks and subject the Bank to increased scrutiny from its stakeholders. In addition, the Bank may be subject to legal and regulatory risks relating to E&S matters, including regulatory orders, fines, and enforcement actions; financial supervisory capital adequacy requirements; and legal action by shareholders or other stakeholders, including the risks described in the ‘Other Risk Factors – Legal Proceedings’ section. Additionally, different stakeholder groups may have divergent views on E&S-related matters. This divergence increases the risk that any action, or inaction, will be perceived negatively by at least some stakeholders. In the U.S., there has been increased legislative activity by state governments that restricts the flow of capital and investment by financial institutions in state governmental entities, including anti-ESG initiatives that are designed to push back against corporate ESG policies. The Bank is monitoring these trends and assessing their potential impact in the context of TD’s ESG-related practices and policies.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key areas of focus and concern. In the U.S., the regulatory environment for banks is expected to evolve due to changes in government leadership and responses to recent bank failures, with a focus on liquidity, interest rate risk, and incentive compensation. In Europe, uncertainties around the UK-EU relationship and regulatory reforms could increase operational costs and affect the bank's offerings. The bank faces intense competition from both traditional and non-traditional financial service providers, including fintech and big tech companies, which may impact its market share and earnings. TD Bank is investing in artificial intelligence to enhance decision-making and customer experience but acknowledges the challenges in staying competitive. Environmental and social risks, including climate change and social inequalities, pose significant challenges, with the bank under scrutiny to address these issues. The bank is also monitoring anti-ESG legislative trends in the U.S. that could impact its ESG practices. Overall, these factors present financial, reputational, and regulatory risks that could affect the bank's performance and stakeholder relationships."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS81 Failure to successfully manage E&S-related expectations across various divergent perspectives may negatively impact the Bank’s reputation and financial results. “Greenwashing” and “social washing”, where claims of E&S benefits are made in relation to products or services or corporate performance that are false, or which give a misleading impression, have accelerated in focus inside and outside the Bank, and public commitments, new products and disclosures can potentially expose financial institutions to the risk. Prosecution of greenwashing claims has occurred in jurisdictions in which the Bank operates, including Canada, the United States and Europe. The Bank continues to closely monitor trends in E&S-related litigation. Legal Proceedings Given the highly regulated and consumer-facing nature of the financial services industry, the Bank is exposed to significant regulatory, quasi- regulatory and self-regulatory investigations and enforcement proceedings related to its business and operations. In addition, the Bank and its subsidiaries are from time to time named as defendants or are otherwise involved in various class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties related to its businesses and operations. A single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings by multiple federal, provincial, state or local agencies and officials in Canada, the United States or other jurisdictions. Furthermore, if another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by the Bank. Actions currently pending against the Bank, or in which the Bank is otherwise involved, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, disgorgements, injunctions, increased exposure to litigation, business improvement orders, limitations or prohibitions from engaging in business activities, changes to the operation or management of business activities, or other results adverse to the Bank, which could materially affect the Bank’s business, financial condition and operations, and/or cause serious reputational harm to the Bank, which could also affect the Bank’s future business prospects. Moreover, some claims asserted against the Bank may be highly complex and include novel or untested legal theories. The outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate, in some instances, until late in the proceedings, which may last several years. Although the Bank establishes reserves for these matters according to accounting requirements, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be material and may be substantially different from the amounts accrued. Furthermore, the Bank may not establish reserves for matters where the outcome is uncertain. Regulators and other government agencies examine the operations of the Bank and its subsidiaries on both a routine- and targeted-exam basis, and they may pursue regulatory settlements, criminal proceedings or other enforcement actions against the Bank in the future. For additional information relating to the Bank’s material legal proceedings, refer to Note 26 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. Ability to Attract, Develop, and Retain Key Talent The Bank’s future performance is dependent on the availability of qualified talent and the Bank’s ability to attract, develop, and retain key talent. The Bank’s management understands that the competition for talent continues across geographies, industries, and emerging capabilities in a number of sectors including financial services. This competition is expected to continue as a result of shifts in employee preferences, tight labour market conditions, inflationary pressures and economic conditions, and remote roles providing opportunities across geographic boundaries. This could result in increased attrition particularly in areas where core professional and specialized skills are required. Annually, the Bank undertakes a talent review process to assess critical capability requirements for all areas of the business. Through this process, an assessment of current executive leadership, technical and core capabilities, as well as talent development opportunities is completed against both near term and future business needs, which supports the succession planning process. The outcomes from the process inform plans at both the enterprise and business levels to retain, develop, or acquire talent and the plans are then actioned throughout the course of the year. Although it is the goal of the Bank’s management resource policies and practices to attract, develop, and retain key talent employed by the Bank or an entity acquired by the Bank, the Bank may not be able to do so, and these actions may not be sufficient to mitigate against attrition. Foreign Exchange Rates, Interest Rates, Credit Spreads, and Equity Prices Foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit spread, and equity price movements in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions in which the Bank does business impact the Bank’s financial position and its future earnings. Changes in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the global foreign exchange rates may also affect the earnings of the Bank’s small business, commercial, and corporate customers. A change in the level of interest rates affects the interest spread between the Bank’s deposits and other liabilities, and loans, and as a result, impacts the Bank’s net interest income. In particular, rising interest rates would increase the Bank’s interest income but could also have adverse impacts on the Bank’s cost of funding for loans and may also result in the risks outlined under the heading ‘Inflation, Rising Rates and Recession’. A change in the level of credit spreads affects the relative valuation of assets and liabilities, and as a result, impacts the Bank’s earnings and could also result in significant losses if, to generate liquidity, the Bank has to sell assets that have suffered a decline in value. A change in equity prices impacts the Bank’s financial position and its future earnings, due to unhedged positions the Bank holds in tradeable equity securities. The trading and non-trading market risk frameworks and policies manage the Bank’s risk appetite for known market risk, but such activities may not be sufficient to mitigate against such market risk, and the Bank remains exposed to unforeseen market risk. Interconnectivity of Financial Institutions The financial services industry is highly interconnected in that a significant volume of transactions occur among the members of that industry. The interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with particular central agents, exchanges and clearinghouses, and the increased centrality of these entities, increase the risk that a financial or operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or result in financial loss or liability to our clients.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key risks and challenges facing the bank. Firstly, the bank is concerned about managing environmental and social (E&S) expectations, particularly the risks of \"greenwashing\" and \"social washing,\" which could harm its reputation and financial results. Legal proceedings are another significant risk, with the bank facing regulatory investigations and litigation that could lead to financial and reputational damage. The bank also emphasizes the importance of attracting and retaining key talent amid competitive labor market conditions. Additionally, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, and equity prices pose financial risks, potentially affecting the bank's earnings and financial position. Lastly, the interconnectedness of financial institutions increases the risk of industry-wide failures, which could impact the bank's operations and client services."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS82 Additionally, the Bank routinely executes brokered deposit, securities, trading, derivative and foreign exchange transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including banks, investment banks, governments, central banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. A rapid deterioration of such a counterparty, or of a significant market participant that is not a counterparty of the Bank, could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in related or dependent industries, and can lead to substantial or cascading disruption within the financial markets, and such conditions could cause the Bank to incur significant losses or other adverse impacts to the Bank’s financial condition, including its liquidity. For example, the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023 in the U.S. and their placement into receivership led to liquidity risk and concerns at many other financial institutions. In addition, there is no assurance that bank regulators or governmental authorities will provide support in the event of the failure or financial distress of other banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion. Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Transition Various interest rates and other indices that are deemed to be “benchmarks” (including IBOR benchmarks such as the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR)) have been, and continue to be, the subject of international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. As a result of the global benchmark reform initiative, efforts to transition away from IBORs to alternative reference rates (ARRs) have either concluded or have been continuing in various jurisdictions. Most notably, from June 30, 2023, all USD LIBOR tenors have either ceased or are published only on a synthetic basis for use in legacy contracts that have no other fallback solution, while the CDOR transition is still in progress. The ongoing transition to ARRs may result in market dislocation and have other adverse consequences to the Bank, its customers, market participants, and the financial services industry. In Canada specifically, the expected discontinuation of the BA lending model, which is responsible for creating the BA investment securities that are sold to money market investors, might also have impacts to Bank’s investment portfolios holdings and impact related earnings. The Bank has significant contractual rights, obligations and exposures referenced to various benchmarks and the discontinuance of, or changes to, such benchmark rates could adversely affect the Bank’s business and results of operations. The Bank has established an enterprise-wide, cross functional initiative with senior executive oversight, to evaluate and monitor the impact of the market, financial, operational, legal, technology and other risks on its products, services, systems, models, documents, processes, and risk management frameworks with the intention of managing the impact through appropriate mitigating actions, but such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate against the impact of all such risks. In addition to operational challenges, market risks also arise because the new reference rates are likely to differ from the prior benchmark rates resulting in differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions, require alternative hedging strategies, or affect the Bank’s capital and liquidity planning and management. Additionally, any adverse impacts on the value of and return on existing instruments and contracts for the Bank’s clients may present an increased risk of litigation, regulatory intervention, and possible reputational damage. Accounting Policies and Methods Used by the Bank The Bank’s accounting policies and estimates are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements, and its reputation. The Bank has established procedures designed to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates and adopting new accounting standards occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Significant accounting policies as well as current and future changes in accounting policies are described in Note 2 and Note 4, respectively, and significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions are described in Note 3 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. Impact of Pandemics Pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease in Canada, the U.S., or worldwide have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on the Bank’s results, business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and could result in changes to the way the Bank operates. Pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease may create, operational and compliance risks, including the need to implement and execute new programs and procedures for the Bank’s products and services; provide enhanced safety measures for its employees and customers; address the risk and increased incidence of attempted fraudulent activity and cyber security threat behaviour; and protect the integrity and functionality of the Bank’s systems, networks, and data as a larger number of employees may be required to work in a hybrid environment. The Bank remains exposed to human capital risks, risks arising from mental wellness concerns for employees due to issues related to health and safety matters, and increased levels of workforce absenteeism with the possible emergence of new pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks. Suppliers and other third parties upon which the Bank relies have, and may continue to be exposed to similar and other risks which in turn impact the Bank’s operations. Increased levels of workforce absenteeism and disruption for the Bank and its suppliers and other third parties upon which the Bank relies, may increase operational and compliance risks for the Bank. Increased absenteeism and disruption may also increase the Bank’s exposure to the other risks described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of this document. Consumer behaviour may change in the event of new pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease. Changes in consumer behaviour may impact the macroeconomic and business environment, societal and business norms, and fiscal, tax and regulatory policy. Such developments could have an adverse impact on the Bank’s business operations, the quality and continuity of services provided to customers, and the results of the Bank’s operations and financial condition, including making the Bank’s longer-term business, balance sheet and budget planning more difficult or costly. The Bank may be criticized or face increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny, customer disputes, negative publicity, or exposure to litigation (including class actions, or regulatory and government actions and proceedings) as a result of the effects of pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks on market and economic conditions, including as a result of the Bank’s participation (directly or on behalf of customers) in governmental assistance programs, the Bank’s deferral and other types of customer assistance programs, and the impact or effectiveness of the Bank’s health and safety measures on its customers and employees. Pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease may result in further increases in certain types of the risks outlined in the Risk Factors and Management section of this document, including the Bank’s top and emerging, strategic, credit, market, operational, model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, and reputational risks.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key risks and challenges facing the bank. Firstly, the bank is exposed to counterparty risks, where the deterioration of financial institutions could lead to significant market disruptions and potential losses. The closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in 2023 exemplify such risks. Secondly, the transition from Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) to alternative reference rates (ARRs) poses operational and market risks, potentially affecting the bank's financial performance and leading to litigation or reputational damage. The bank has established a cross-functional initiative to manage these risks, but challenges remain. Additionally, the bank's accounting policies involve complex judgments, and changes in these could materially impact financial statements. Lastly, pandemics and infectious disease outbreaks present operational, compliance, and human capital risks, potentially affecting the bank's operations, financial condition, and customer relations. These events could also lead to increased litigation and regulatory scrutiny."

The Bank’s goal is to earn a stable and sustainable rate of return for every dollar of risk it takes, while putting significant emphasis on investing in its businesses to meet its strategic objectives. The Bank’s Enterprise Risk Framework (ERF) reinforces the Bank’s risk cultur e, which emphasizes transparency and accountability, and supports a common understanding among stakeholders of how the Bank manages risk. The ERF addresses: (1) how the Bank defines the types of risk it is exposed to; (2) how the Bank determines the risks arising from the Bank’s strategy and operations; (3) risk management governance and organization; and (4) how the Bank manages risk through processes that identify and assess, measure, control, monitor, and report risk. The Bank’s risk management r esources and processes are designed to both challenge and enable all its businesses to understand the risks they face and to manage them within the Bank’s risk appetite. RISKS INVOLVED IN TD’S BUSINESSES The Bank’s Risk Inventory sets out the Bank’s major risk categories and r elated subcategories to which the Bank’s businesses and operations could be exposed. The Risk Inventory facilitates consistent risk identification assessment, control, measurement, monitoring, reporting, and disclosure of TD’s risks. The Risk Inventory is the starting point in developing risk management strategies and processes. The Bank’s major risk categories are: Strategic Risk; Credit Risk; Market Risk; Operational Risk; Model Risk; Insurance Risk; Liquidity Risk; Capital Adequacy Risk; Legal, Regulatory Compliance and Conduct Risk; and Reputational Risk. Major Risk Categories Strategic Risk Credit Risk Market Risk Operational Risk Model Risk Insurance Risk Liquidity Risk Capital Adequacy Risk Legal, Regulatory Compliance and Conduct Risk Reputational Risk The Bank’s RAS is the primary means used to communicate how the Bank views risk and determines the type and amount of risk it is willing to take to deliver on its strategy and to enhance shar eholder value. In setting the risk appetite, the Bank takes into account its vision, purpose, strategy, shared commitments, and capacity to bear risk under both normal and recessionary/stress conditions. The core risk principles for the Bank’s RAS are as follows: The Bank takes risks required to build its business, but only if those risks: 1. Fit the business strategy, and can be understood and managed. 2. Do not expose the enterprise to any significant single loss events; TD does not ‘bet the Bank’ on any single acquisition, business, or pr oduct. 3. Do not risk harming the TD brand. The Bank’s Risk Appetite Gover nance Framework (RAGF) describes the assumptions, responsibilities, and processes established to define, maintain, and govern TD’s risk appetite including RAS and all RAS measures. The Bank considers current operating conditions and the impact of emerging risks in developing and applying its risk appetite. Adherence to enterprise risk appetite is managed and monitored across the Bank and is informed by the RAGF and a broad collection of principles, policies, processes, and tools. The Bank’s RAS describes, by major risk category, the Bank’s risk principles and establishes both qualitative and quantitative measur es, thresholds, and limits, as appropriate. RAS measures consider both normal and stress scenarios and include those that can be monitored at the enterprise level and cascaded to the segments. Risk Management is responsible for establishing practices and processes to formulate, monitor , and report on the Bank’s RAS measures. The Risk Management function also monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of these practices and processes, as well as the RAS measures. Compliance with RAS principles and measures is reported regularly to senior management, the Board, and the Risk Committee of the Board (Risk Committee); other measures are tracked on an ongoing basis by management, and escalated to senior management and the Board, as required. Risk Management regularly assesses management’s performance against the Bank’s RAS measures. Risk culture is the attitudes and behaviours around taking and managing risk in the Bank and is guided by our Shar ed Commitments and the TD Culture Framework. Risk culture is one of the attributes that is integral to the Bank’s overall organisational culture. The Risk Committee engages with the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) who leads a diverse team of risk professionals to drive a proactive risk culture. The central oversight for organisational culture at TD is led by Human Resources (HR) in partnership with Risk Management. The Bank’s risk culture starts with the “tone at the top” set by the Board, Chief Executive Of ficer (CEO), and the Senior Executive Team (SET), and is supported by the Bank’s vision, purpose, shared commitments, the Bank’s Code of Conduct and Ethics and risk appetite. These governing objectives describe and drive the behaviours, decision making, and business practices that the Bank seeks to foster among its employees, in building a culture where the only risks taken are those that can be understood and managed. The Bank’s risk culture embraces accountability and continuous learning (especially from past experiences), and encourages open communication and transparency on all aspects of risk taking. The Bank’s employees are expected to challenge and escalate when they believe the Bank is operating outside of its desired risk culture or risk appetite. Ethical behaviour, integrity and conduct are pillars of TD’s culture and are key components of the Bank’ s risk culture. The Bank’s Code of Conduct and Ethics guides employees and directors to make decisions that meet the highest standards of integrity, professionalism, and ethical behaviour. Every Bank employee and director is expected and required to assess business decisions and actions on behalf of the organization in light of whether it is right, legal, and fair. The Bank’s desired risk culture is reinforced by linking compensation to management’ s performance against the Bank’s risk appetite. An annual consolidated assessment of management’s performance against the RAS is prepared by Risk Management, reviewed by the Risk Committee, and is used by the HR Committee as a key input into compensation decisions. All executives are individually assessed against objectives that include consideration of risk and control behaviours. This comprehensive approach allows the Bank to consider whether the actions of executive management resulted in risk and control events within their area of responsibility. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS84 In addition, Oversight Functions operate independently from segments, supported by an organizational structure that provides objective oversight and independent challenge. Oversight Function heads, including the CRO, have unfettered access to respective Board committees to raise risk, compliance, and other issues. Lastly, awareness and communication of the Bank’s RAS and the ERF take place across the organization through enterprise risk communication programs, employee orientation and training, and participation in internal risk management conferences. These activities further strengthen the Bank’s risk culture by increasing the knowledge and understanding of the Bank’s expectations for risk taking. The Bank’s risk governance structure emphasizes and balances strong independent oversight with clear ownership for risk across the Bank. Under the Bank’s approach to risk governance, a “three lines of defence” model is employed, in which the first line of defence is the risk owner, the second line provides risk oversight, and the third line is internal audit. The Bank’s risk governance model includes a senior management committee structure that is designed to support transparent risk reporting and discussions. The Bank’s overall risk and control oversight is provided by the Board and its committees. The CEO and SET determine the Bank’s long-term direction which is then carried out by segments within the Bank’s risk appetite. Risk Management, headed by the CRO, sets enterprise risk strategy and policy and provides independent oversight to support a comprehensive and proactive risk management approach. The CRO, who is also a member of the SET, has unfettered access to the Risk Committee. The Bank has a subsidiary governance framework to support its overall risk governance structure, including Boards of Directors, and committees for various subsidiary entities where appropriate. Within the U.S. Retail business segment, risk and control oversight is provided by a separate and distinct Board of Directors which includes a fully independent Board Risk Committee and Board Audit Committee. The U.S. Chief Risk Officer (U.S. CRO) has unfettered access to the U.S. Board Risk Committee. The following section provides an overview of the key roles and responsibilities involved in risk management. The Bank’s risk governance structure is illustrated in the following figure. Chief Executive Officer Senior Executive Team Board of Directors Executive Committees Asset Liability & Capital Committee (ALCO) Operational Risk Oversight Committee (OROC) Disclosure Committee (DC) Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) Enterprise Reputational Risk Committee (ERRC) Governance, Risk, and Oversight Functions Business and Corporate Segments Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking Wealth Management and InsuranceU.S. Retail CorporateWholesale Banking Internal Audit Internal Audit Corporate Governance Committee Audit Committee Human Resources Committee Risk Committee TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 85 The Board of Directors The Board oversees the Bank’s strategic direction, the implementation of an ef fective risk culture and the internal control framework across the enterprise. It accomplishes its risk management mandate both directly and indirectly through its four committees: Audit, Risk, HR, and Corporate Governance. The Board reviews and approves the Bank’s RAS and related RAS measures annually, and reviews the Bank’s risk profile and performance relative to its risk appetite measures and principles. The Audit Committee The Audit Committee oversees financial reporting, the adequacy and ef fectiveness of internal controls, including internal controls over financial reporting, and the activities of Internal Audit, Finance, Regulatory Compliance, and Anti-Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing/Economic Sanctions/Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption. The Risk Committee The Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending TD’s RAS for appr oval by the Board annually. The Risk Committee oversees the management of TD’s risk profile and performance relative to its risk appetite. In support of this oversight, the Committee reviews and approves significant enterprise-wide risk management frameworks and policies that are designed to help manage the Bank’s major risk exposures, and monitors the management of risks, issues and trends. The Human Resources Committee The HR Committee, in addition to its other responsibilities, oversees the management of the Bank’ s culture. It also satisfies itself that HR risks are appropriately identified, assessed, and managed in a manner consistent with the risk programs within the Bank, and with the sustainable achievement of the Bank’s business objectives. The Corporate Governance Committee The Corporate Governance Committee, in addition to its other r esponsibilities, develops, and where appropriate, recommends to the Board for approval corporate governance principles, including the Bank’s Code of Conduct and Ethics, aimed at fostering a healthy governance culture at the Bank, and also acts as the conduct review committee for the Bank, including providing oversight of conduct risk. In addition, the committee has oversight of the Bank’s alignment with its purpose and its strategy, performance and reporting on corporate responsibility for E&S matters, and oversees the establishment and maintenance of policies in respect of the Bank’s compliance with the consumer protection provisions of the Financial Consumer Protection Framework. Chief Executive Officer and Senior Executive Team The CEO and the SET develop and recommend to the Board the Bank’s long-term strategic dir ection and also develop and recommend for Board approval TD’s RAS. The SET members set the “tone at the top” and manage risk in accordance with the Bank’s RAS while considering the impact of current and emerging risks on the Bank’s strategy and risk profile. This accountability includes identifying, understanding and communicating significant risks to the Risk Committee. Executive Committees The CEO, in consultation with the CRO establishes the Bank’s executive committee structur e. These committees are chaired by SET members and meet regularly to oversee governance, risk, and control activities and to review and monitor risk strategies and associated risk activities and practices. The ERMC, chaired by the CEO, oversees the management of major enterprise gover nance, risk, and control activities and promotes an integrated and effective risk management culture. The following executive committees have been established to manage specific major risks based on the nature of the risk and related business activity: • ALCO – chaired by the Chief Finance Officer (CFO), the ALCO oversees directly and through its standing subcommittees (the Enterprise Capital Committee and Global Liquidity and Funding (GLF) Committee), the management of the Bank’s consolidated non-trading market risk and each of its consolidated liquidity, funding, investments, and capital positions. • OROC – chaired by the CRO, the OROC oversees the identification, monitoring, and control of key risks within the Bank’s operational risk profile. • DC – chaired by the CFO, the DC oversees that appropriate controls and procedures are in place and operating to permit timely, accurate, balanced, and compliant disclosure. • ERRC – chaired by the CRO, the ERRC oversees the management of reputational risk within the Bank’s risk appetite, provides a forum for discussion, review, and escalation for non-traditional risks, and acts as a decisioning body in cases where urgent risk assessment and decisions are required for select high-risk cross-segment/enterprise changes and where decision rights run across more than one group. Risk Management The Risk Management function, headed by the CRO, provides independent oversight of enterprise-wide risk management, risk gover nance, and control, including the setting of risk strategy and policy to manage risk in alignment with the Bank’s risk appetite and business strategy. Risk Management’s primary objective is to support a comprehensive and proactive approach to risk management that promotes a strong risk culture. Risk Management works with the segments and other oversight functions to establish policies, standards, and limits that align with the Bank’s risk appetite and monitors and reports on current and emerging risks and compliance with the Bank’s risk appetite. The CRO leads and directs a diverse team of risk management professionals organized to oversee risks arising from each of the Bank’s major risk categories. There is an established process in place for the identification and assessment of top and emerging risks, including tail risk i.e., low probability events that can result in extremely large quantifiable losses. In addition, the Bank has clear procedures governing when and how risk events and issues are communicated to senior management and the Risk Committee. Business and Corporate Segments Each business and corporate segment has a dedicated risk management function that reports directly to a senior risk executive who, in turn, reports to the CRO. This structure supports an appropriate level of independent oversight while emphasizing accountability for risk within the segment. Business and corporate management is responsible for setting the segment- level risk appetite and measures, which are reviewed and challenged by Risk Management, endorsed by the ERMC, and approved by the CEO, to align with the Bank’s RAS and manage risk within approved risk limits. The corporate segment includes service and control groups (e.g., Platforms and Technology; Transformation, Enablement and Customer Experience; HR and Finance) that, like business segments, are responsible for assessing risk, designing and implementing controls and monitoring and reporting their ongoing effectiveness to safeguard TD from exceeding its risk appetite. Internal Audit The Bank’s Internal Audit function provides independent and objective assurance to the Boar d regarding the reliability and effectiveness of key elements of the Bank’s risk management, internal control, and governance processes. Global Compliance Department (Compliance) Compliance is an independent regulatory compliance risk and associated conduct risk management and oversight function for business conduct and market conduct laws, rules and r egulations. Compliance is also responsible for the design and oversight of the Bank’s Regulatory Compliance Management (RCM) program in accordance with the Enterprise RCM Framework and related standards and supports the provision of the Chief Compliance Officer’s opinion to the Audit Committee as to whether the RCM controls are sufficiently robust in achieving compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulatory requirements enterprise-wide. Global Anti-Money Laundering (GAML) GAML is responsible for the oversight of TD’s regulatory compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Anti-T errorist Financing, Economic Sanctions, and Anti-Bribery/Anti-Corruption regulatory compliance and broader prudential risk management across the Bank in alignment with enterprise AML policies so that the money laundering, terrorist financing, economic sanctions, and bribery and corruption risks are appropriately identified and mitigated. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS86 Three Lines of Defence In order to further the understanding of responsibilities for risk management, the Bank employs the following “three lines of defence” model that describes the respective accountabilities of each line of defence in managing risk across the Bank. First Line Risk Owner Identify and Control • Own, identify, manage, measure, and monitor current and emerging risks in day-to-day activities, operations, products, and services. • Promote ongoing initiatives to raise the profile of risk considerations and understand key risks impacting the business. • Implement governance and control processes to promote risk awareness, clear risk ownership within the business, and personal accountability. • Design, implement, and maintain appropriate mitigating controls, and assess the design and operating effectiveness of those controls. • Establish controls to help ensure that activities are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. • Monitor and report on risk profile so that activities are within TD’s risk appetite and policies. • Implement risk-based approval processes for all new products, activities, processes, and systems. • Escalate risk issues and develop and implement action plans in a timely manner. • Deliver training, tools, and advice to support its accountabilities. • Promote a strong risk management culture. Second Line Risk Oversight Set Standards and Challenge • Establish and communicate enterprise governance, risk, and control strategies, frameworks, and policies. • Provide oversight and independent challenge to the first line through an effective objective assessment, that is evidenced and documented where significant, including: – Challenge the quality and sufficiency of the first line’s risk activities; – Identify and assess current and emerging risks and controls, using a risk-based approach, as appropriate; – Monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control activities; – Review and discuss assumptions, material risk decisions and outcomes; and – Aggregate and share results across business lines and control areas to identify similar events, patterns, or broad trends. • Identify and assess, and communicate relevant regulatory changes. • Develop and implement risk measurement tools so that activities are within TD’s RAS. • Monitor and report on compliance with the Bank’s RAS and policies. • Escalate risk issues in a timely manner. • Report on the risks of the Bank on an enterprise-wide and disaggregated level to the Board and/or senior management, independently of the business lines or operational management. • Provide training, tools, and advice to support the first line in carrying out its accountabilities. • Promote a strong risk management culture. Third Line Internal Audit Independent Assurance • Verify independently that TD’s ERF is designed and operating effectively. • Validate the effectiveness of the first and second lines of defence in fulfilling their mandates and managing risk. In support of a strong risk culture, the Bank applies the following principles in governing how it manages risk: • Enterprise-Wide in Scope – Risk Management will span all areas of the Bank, including third-party alliances and joint venture undertakings to the extent they may impact the Bank, and all boundaries, both geographic and regulatory. • Transparent and Effective Communication – Matters relating to risk will be communicated and escalated in a timely, accurate, and forthright manner. • Enhanced Accountability – Risks will be explicitly owned, understood, and actively managed by business management and all employees, individually and collectively. • Independent Oversight – Risk policies, monitoring, and reporting will be established and conducted independently and objectively. • Integrated Risk and Control Culture – Risk Management disciplines will be integrated into the Bank’s daily routines, decision-making, and strategy formulation. • Strategic Balance – Risk will be managed to an acceptable level of exposure, recognizing the need to protect and grow shareholder value to foster a sound strategic balance between risk mitigation and risk enablement within TD’s risk appetite. • Leadership Accountability – Leaders are accountable to demonstrate, influence and drive the right risk behaviours and risk mindset with colleagues and stakeholders. The Bank’s comprehensive and proactive approach to risk management is comprised of four processes: risk identification and assessment, measurement, control, and monitoring and reporting. Risk Identification and Assessment Risk identification and assessment is focused on recognizing and understanding existing risks, risks that may arise from new or evolving business initiatives, aggregate risks, tail risks, and emerging risks from the changing environment. The Bank’s objective is to establish and maintain integrated risk identification and assessment processes that enhance the understanding of risk interdependencies, consider how risk types intersect, and support the identification of emerging risks. To that end, the Bank’s Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing (EWST) program enables senior management, the Board, and its committees to identify and articulate enterprise-wide risks and understand potential vulnerabilities for the Bank. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS87 Risk Measurement The ability to quantify risks is a key component of the Bank’s risk management process. The Bank’s risk measurement process aligns with regulatory requirements such as capital adequacy, leverage ratios, liquidity measures, stress testing, and maximum credit exposure guidelines established by its regulators. Additionally, the Bank has a process in place to quantify risks to provide accurate and timely measurements of the risks it assumes. In quantifying risk, the Bank uses various risk measurement methodologies, including Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis, scenario analysis, stress testing, and limits. Other examples of risk measurements include credit exposures, PCL, peer comparisons, trending analysis, liquidity coverage, leverage ratios, capital adequacy metrics, and operational risk event notification metrics. The Bank also requires segments and oversight functions to assess key risks and internal controls through a structured Risk and Control Self-Assessment program. Internal and external risk events are monitored to assess whether the Bank’s internal controls are effective. This allows the Bank to identify, escalate, and monitor significant risk issues as needed. Risk Control The Bank’s risk control processes are established and communicated through the Risk Committee and management approved policies, and associated management approved procedures, control limits, and delegated authorities which reflect its risk appetite and risk tolerances. The Bank’s approach to risk control also includes risk and capital assessments to appropriately capture key risks in its measurement and management of capital adequacy. This involves the review, challenge, and endorsement by senior management committees of the Bank’s ICAAP and related economic capital practices. The Bank’s performance is measured based on the allocation of risk-based capital to businesses and the cost charged against that capital. Risk Monitoring and Reporting The Bank monitors and reports on risk levels on a regular basis against its risk appetite and Risk Management reports on its risk monitoring activities to senior management, the Board and its Committees, and appropriate executive and management committees. Complementing regular risk monitoring and reporting, ad hoc risk reporting is provided to senior management, the Risk Committee, and the Board, as appropriate, for new and emerging risks or any significant changes to the Bank’s risk profile. The Bank is developing methodologies and approaches for climate scenario analysis through participation in industry-wide working groups and is working to embed the assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities into relevant Bank processes. Stress Testing Stress testing is an integral component of the Bank’s risk management framework and serves as a key component of the Bank’s capital, strategic and financial planning processes. Stress testing at the Bank comprises an annual enterprise-wide stress test featuring a range of scenarios, prescribed regulatory stress tests in multiple jurisdictions, and various ongoing and ad hoc stress tests and analysis. The results of these stress tests and analysis enable management to assess the impact of geopolitical events and changes to economic and other market factors on the Bank’s financial condition and assist in the determination of capital and liquidity adequacy and targets, risk appetite and other limits. These exercises enable the identification and quantification of vulnerabilities, the monitoring of changes in risk profile relative to risk appetite limits, and evaluation of business plans. The Bank utilizes a combination of quantitative modelling and qualitative approaches to assess the impact of changes in the macroeconomic environment on the Bank’s income statement, balance sheet, and capital and liquidity position under hypothetical stress situations. Stress testing engages senior management across the lines of business, Finance, TBSM, Economics, and Risk Management. Stress test results are reviewed, challenged and approved by senior management and executive oversight committees. The Bank’s Risk Committee also reviews, challenges, and discusses the results. The results are submitted, disclosed, or shared with regulators as required or requested. Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing The Bank conducts an annual EWST as part of a comprehensive capital and liquidity planning, strategic, and financial exercise that is a key component of the Bank’s ICAAP framework. The EWST results are considered in establishing the Bank’s capital and liquidity targets and risk appetite limits, evaluating the Bank’s strategies and business plan, and identifying actions that senior management could take to manage the impact of stress events. In addition, the Bank conducts ad hoc stress tests and analysis for assessing the impact of events deemed to be potentially material or of concern in support of senior management’s response to an uncertain or rapidly changing operating environment. The program is subject to a well-defined governance structure that facilitates executive oversight and engagement throughout the organization. EWST methodologies and results are reviewed and challenged by line of business, finance and risk teams. Stress testing results are further reviewed by ERMC and are also shared with the Board and regulators. The Bank’s EWST program involves the development, execution and assessment of stress scenarios with varying features and degrees of severity on the balance sheet, income statement, capital, liquidity, and leverage. It enables management to identify and assess enterprise-wide risks and understand potential vulnerabilities, and changes to the risk profile of the Bank. Stress scenarios are developed with consideration of the Bank’s key business activities, exposures, concentrations and vulnerabilities. The scenarios are designed to be consistent with regulatory stress testing frameworks and cover a wide variety of risk factors meaningful to the Bank’s risk profiles in North America and globally including changes to unemployment, gross domestic product, home prices, and interest rates. For the 2023 EWST program, the Bank developed and assessed scenarios that explored emerging risks such as inflation, rising interest rates, increased competition/market pressure on fees, Net Interest Margin compression reflecting higher funding costs, and elevated fraud and cyber security risk. The stress testing scenarios included, a plausible typical recession scenario calibrated to historical recessions in Canada and the U.S. and a low probability and highly severe stagflation scenario targeting TD-specific risks and vulnerabilities in support of the ICAAP . Supplemental analysis performed during 2023 explored the risk that non-bank financial institutions and/or other non-traditional competitors disrupt the consumer payment space and capital impacts due to Basel III Reforms (B3R) to support senior management in assessing key risks. Other Stress Tests and Analysis Ongoing stress testing and scenario analyses within specific risk types, such as market risk, liquidity risk, retail and wholesale credit risk, operational risk, and insurance risk, supplement and support our enterprise-wide analyses. Results from these risk-specific programs are used in a variety of decision-making processes including risk limit setting, portfolio composition evaluation, risk appetite articulation and business strategy implementation. In addition, the Bank conducts ad hoc stress tests and analysis for targeted portfolios, to evaluate potential vulnerabilities to specific changes in economic and market conditions. Stress tests are also conducted on certain legal entities and jurisdictions, in line with prescribed regulatory requirements. The Bank’s U.S.- holding company and operating bank subsidiaries’ capital planning process including execution of stress tests are conducted in accordance with the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act stress testing (DFAST) requirements. In addition, certain Bank subsidiaries in Singapore, Ireland, and the United Kingdom conduct stress testing exercises as part of their respective ICAAP . The Bank undertakes other internal and regulatory based stress tests including liquidity and market risk, which are detailed in the respective sections. The Bank also conducts scenario and sensitivity analysis as part of the Recovery and Resolution Planning program to assess potential mitigating actions and contingency planning strategies, as required. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Strategic Risk Strategic risk is the risk of sub-optimal outcomes (including financial loss or reputational damage) arising from the Bank’s choice of strategies, improper implementation of chosen strategies, inability to implement chosen strategies, an inadequate response to disruption of the Bank’s strategies, or exposure to tail risk (i.e., low probability events that can result in extremely large quantifiable losses). Strategies include current operations and merger and acquisition activities. The CEO manages Strategic Risk, supported by the members of the SET and the ERMC. The CEO, together with the SET, defines the overall strategy , in consultation with, and subject to approval by, the Board. The Enterprise Strategy group, under the leadership of the Chief Financial Officer, is charged with developing the Bank’s long-term strategy and shorter-term strategic objectives and priorities with input and support from senior executives across the Bank. Each member of the SET is responsible for establishing and managing long-term strategy and shorter-term priorities for their ar eas of responsibility (business segment or corporate function), and ensuring such strategies are aligned with the Bank’s long-term strategy and short-term strategic objectives and priorities, and are within the Bank’s Risk Appetite. Each SET member is also accountable to the CEO for identifying, assessing, measuring, controlling, monitoring, and reporting on the effectiveness and risks of their business segment or corporate function’s strategies. The CEO, SET members, and other senior executives report to the Board on the implementation of the Bank’s strategies, identifying r elated risks, and explaining how those risks are managed. The ERMC oversees the identification and monitoring of significant and emerging risks related to the Bank’ s strategies so that mitigating actions are taken where appropriate. The Bank’s enterprise-wide strategies and operating performance, and those of significant business segments and corporate functions, are assessed r egularly by the CEO and members of the SET through an integrated financial and strategic planning process, as well as operating results reviews. The Bank’s RAS establishes strategic risk limits at the enterprise and business segment level. Limits include qualitative and quantitative assessments and are established to monitor and contr ol business concentrations, strategic disruption, and E&S risks. The Bank’s annual integrated planning process establishes plans at the enterprise and segment levels. The plans include external market outlooks, long and short-term strategies, target metrics, key risks / mitigants, and alignment with the Bank’ s strategy and Risk Appetite. Operating results are reviewed periodically during the year to monitor segment-level performance against the integrated financial and strategic plan. These reviews include an evaluation of the long-term strategy and short-term strategic priorities of each business segment, including the operating envir onment, relative performance and competitive positioning assessments, initiative execution status, and key business risks. The frequency of operating results reviews depends on the risk profile and size of the business segment or corporate function. The Bank’s strategic risk and adherence to its Risk Appetite is reviewed by the ERMC in the normal course, as well as by the Board. Additionally , material acquisitions are assessed for their fit with the Bank’s strategy and Risk Appetite in accordance with the Bank’s Due Diligence Policy. This assessment is reviewed by the SET and Board as part of the decision process. The shaded ar eas of this MD&A represent a discussion on risk management policies and procedur es relating to credit, market, and liquidity risks as required under IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which permits these specific disclosures to be included in the MD&A. Therefore, the shaded areas which include Credit Risk, Market Risk, and Liquidity Risk, form an integral part of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022. The Basel Framework The objective of the Basel Framework is to improve the consistency of capital requir ements internationally and establish minimum regulatory capital standards which adequately capture risks. The Basel Framework sets different risk-sensitive approaches for calculating credit, market, and operational RWA. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of loss if a borrower or counterparty in a transaction fails to meet its agreed payment obligations. Credit risk is one of the most significant and pervasive risks in banking. Every loan, extension of credit, or transaction that involves the transfer of payments between the Bank and other parties or financial institutions exposes the Bank to some degree of credit risk. The Bank’ s primary objective is to be methodical in its credit risk assessment so that the Bank can understand, select, and manage its exposures to reduce significant fluctuations in earnings. The Bank’s strategy is to include central oversight of credit risk in each business, and reinforce a culture of transparency, accountability , independence, and balance. The responsibility for credit risk management is enterprise-wide. To reinfor ce ownership of credit risk, credit risk control functions are integrated into each business, but also report to Risk Management. Each business segment’s credit risk control unit is responsible for its credit decisions and must comply with established policies, exposur e guidelines, cr edit approval limits, and policy/limit exception procedures. It must also adhere to established enterprise-wide standar ds of credit assessment and obtain Risk Management’s approval for credit decisions beyond its discretionary authority. Risk Management is accountable for oversight of credit risk by developing policies that govern and contr ol portfolio risks, and approval of product-specific policies, as required. The Risk Committee oversees the management of credit risk and annually approves certain significant cr edit risk policies. The Bank’s Credit Risk Management Framework outlines the internal risk and control structur e to manage credit risk and includes risk appetite, policies, processes, limits and governance. The Credit Risk Management Framework is maintained by Risk Management and supports alignment with the Bank’s risk appetite for credit risk. Credit risk policies and credit decision-making strategies, as well as the discretionary limits of of ficers throughout the Bank for extending lines of credit are centrally approved by Risk Management, and the Board where applicable. Limits are established to monitor and control country, industry, product, geographic, and group exposur e risks in the portfolios in accordance with enterprise-wide policies. In the Bank’s Retail businesses, the Bank uses established underwriting guidelines (which include collateral and loan-to-value requir ements) along with approved scoring techniques and standards in extending, monitoring, and reporting personal credit. Credit scores and decision strategies are used in the origination and ongoing management of new and existing retail credit exposures. Scoring models and decision strategies utilize a combination of borrower attributes, including, but not limited to, income, employment status, existing loan exposure and performance, and size of total bank relationship, as well as external data such as credit bureau information, to determine the amount of credit the Bank is prepared to extend to retail customers and to estimate future credit performance. Established policies and procedures are in place to govern the use, and 88",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report emphasizes a comprehensive risk management strategy aimed at achieving stable and sustainable profitability. The bank employs an Enterprise Risk Framework (ERF) to manage various risk categories, including strategic, credit, market, operational, and reputational risks, among others. The Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) guides the bank's risk-taking activities, ensuring they align with business strategies and do not jeopardize the bank's stability or brand. The bank's risk governance is structured around a \"three lines of defence\" model, involving risk owners, oversight functions, and internal audit, to ensure effective risk management and accountability. The bank also integrates risk management into its culture, linking compensation to risk performance and promoting transparency and ethical behavior. Stress testing and scenario analysis are key components of the bank's risk management, helping to assess the impact of various economic conditions on its financial health. The bank's approach is designed to balance risk mitigation with strategic growth, ensuring risks are understood and managed within its risk appetite."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS monitor and assess the performance of scoring models and decision strategies to align with expected performance results. Retail credit exposures approved within the credit centres are subject to ongoing Retail Risk Management review to assess the effectiveness of credit decisions and risk controls, as well as to identify emerging or systemic issues and trends. Material policy exceptions are tracked and reported and larger dollar exposures and material exceptions to policy are escalated to Retail Risk Management. The Bank’s Commercial Banking and Wholesale Banking businesses use cr edit risk models and policies to establish borrower and facility risk ratings (BRR and FRR), quantify and monitor the level of risk, and to aid in the Bank’s effective management of risk. Risk ratings are also used to determine the amount of credit exposure the Bank is willing to extend to a particular borrower. Management processes are used to monitor country, industry, and borrower or counterparty risk ratings, which include daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual review requirements for credit exposures. The key parameters used in the Bank’s credit risk models are monitored on an ongoing basis. Unanticipated economic or political changes in a foreign country could af fect cross-border payments for goods and services, loans, dividends, and trade-related finance, as well as repatriation of the Bank’s capital in that country. The Bank currently has credit exposure in a number of countries, with the majority of the exposure in North America. The Bank measures country risk using approved risk rating models and qualitative factors that are also used to establish country exposure limits covering all aspects of credit exposure across all businesses. Country risk ratings are managed on an ongoing basis and are subject to a detailed review at least annually. As part of the Bank’s credit risk strategy, the Bank sets limits on the amount of credit it is pr epared to extend to specific industry sectors. The Bank monitors its concentration to any given industry to provide for a diversified loan portfolio and to reduce the risk of undue concentration. The Bank manages this risk using limits based on an internal risk rating score that combines TD’s industry risk rating model and industry analysis, and reviews industry risk ratings to assess whether internal ratings properly reflect the risk of the industry. The Bank assigns a maximum exposure limit or a concentration limit to each major industry segment which is a percentage of its total wholesale and commercial private sector exposure. The Bank may also set limits on the amount of credit it is prepared to extend to a particular entity or group of entities, also r eferred to as “entity risk”. All entity risk is approved by the appropriate decision-making authority using limits based on the entity’s BRR. This exposure is monitored on a regular basis. To determine the potential loss that could be incurred under a range of adverse scenarios, the Bank subjects its cr edit portfolios to stress tests. Stress tests assess vulnerability of the portfolios to the effects of severe but plausible situations, such as an economic downturn or a material market disruption. Credit Risk and the Basel Framework The Bank uses the Basel IRB to calculate credit risk RWA for all material portfolios. Based on exposure class, in accor dance with the OSFI CAR guidelines, either a foundation approach (Foundation Internal Ratings- Based (FIRB)) or advanced approach (Advanced Internal Ratings-Based (AIRB)) is applied. The following risk parameters are used in credit risk RWA calculations and may be subject to prescribed floors in some cases: • Probability of default (PD) – the likelihood that the borrower will not be able to meet its scheduled repayments within a one-year time horizon. • Loss given default (LGD) – the amount of loss the Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a loan, which is expressed as a percentage of exposure at default (EAD). • EAD – the total amount of the Bank’s exposure at the time of default, including certain off-balance sheet items. The FIRB approach primarily uses internally derived PD, while other components such as LGD and EAD are pr escribed. The AIRB approach uses internally derived PD, LGD, and EAD. To continue to qualify to use the IRB approaches for credit risk, the Bank must meet the ongoing conditions and requir ements established by OSFI and the Basel Framework. The Bank regularly assesses its compliance with these requirements. Credit Risk Exposures Subject to the IRB Approaches Banks that adopt the IRB approaches to credit risk must report credit risk exposur es by counterparty type, each having different underlying risk characteristics. These counterparty types may differ from the presentation in the Bank’s 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank’s credit risk exposures are divided into two main portfolios, retail and non-retail. Retail Exposures In the retail portfolio, including individuals and small businesses, the Bank manages exposur es on a pooled basis, using predictive credit scoring techniques. There are three sub-types of retail exposures: residential secured (for example, mortgages and HELOCs), qualifying revolving retail (for example, credit cards, unsecured lines of credit, and overdraft protection products), and other retail (for example, personal loans, including secured automobile loans, student lines of credit, and small business banking credit products). The Bank calculates RWA for its retail exposures using the AIRB appr oach. All retail PD, LGD, and EAD parameter models are based on the internal default and loss performance history for each of the three retail exposure sub-types. These parameters are also used in the calculation of regulatory capital, economic capital, and allowance for credit losses. Account-level PD, LGD, and EAD models are built for each product portfolio and calibrated based on the observed account-level default and loss performance for the portfolio. Consistent with the AIRB approach, the Bank defines default for exposur es as delinquency of 90 days or more for the majority of retail credit portfolios. LGD estimates used in the RWA calculations reflect economic losses, such as, direct and indirect costs as well as any appropriate discount to account for time between default and ultimate recovery. EAD estimates reflect the historically observed utilization of credit limits at default. PD, LGD, and EAD models are calibrated using established statistical methods, such as logistic and linear regression techniques. Predictive attributes in the models may include account attributes, such as loan size, interest rate, and collateral, where applicable; an account’s previous history and current status; an account’s age on book; a customer’s credit bureau attributes; a customer’s other holdings with the Bank; and macroeconomic inputs, such as unemployment rate. For secured products such as residential mortgages, property characteristics, loan-to-value ratios, and a customer’s equity in the property, play a significant role in PD as well as in LGD models. All risk parameter estimates are updated on a quarterly basis based on the r efreshed model inputs. Parameter estimation is fully automated based on approved formulas and is not subject to manual overrides. Exposures are then assigned to pre-defined PD segments based on their estimated long-run average one-year PD. The predictive power of the Bank’s retail credit models is assessed against the most recently available one-year default and loss performance on a quarterly basis. All models ar e also subject to a comprehensive independent validation as outlined in the “Model Risk Management” section of this disclosure. Long-run PD estimates are generated by including key economic indicators, such as inter est rates and unemployment rates, and using their long-run average over the credit cycle to estimate PD. LGD estimates are required to reflect a downturn scenario. Downturn LGD estimates ar e generated by using macroeconomic inputs, such as changes in housing prices and unemployment rates expected in an appropriately severe downturn scenario. For unsecured products, downturn LGD estimates reflect the observed lower recoveries for exposur es defaulted during the 2008 to 2009 recession. For products secured by residential real estate, such as mortgages and HELOCs, downturn LGD reflects the potential impact of a severe housing downturn. EAD estimates similarly reflect a downturn scenario. 89 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The following table maps PD ranges to risk levels: Risk Assessment PD Segment PD Range Low Risk 1 0.00 to 0.15% Normal Risk 2 0.16 to 0.41 3 0.42 to 1.10 Medium Risk 4 1.11 to 2.93 5 2.94 to 4.74 High Risk 6 4.75 to 7.59 7 7.60 to 18.24 8 18.25 to 99.99 Default 9 100.00 Non-Retail Exposures In the non-retail portfolio, the Bank manages exposures on an individual borrower basis, using industry and sector -specific credit risk models, and expert judgment. The Bank has categorized non-retail credit risk exposures according to the following Basel counterparty types: corporate, including wholesale and commercial customers, sovereign, and bank. Under the IRB approaches, CMHC-insured mortgages are considered sovereign risk and are therefore classified as non-retail. The Bank evaluates credit risk for non-retail exposures by using both a BRR and FRR. The Bank uses this system for all corporate, sover eign, and bank exposures. The Bank determines the risk ratings using industry and sector-specific credit risk models that are based on internal historical data. In Canada, for both the wholesale and commercial lending portfolios, credit risk models are calibrated based on internal data beginning in 1994. In the U.S., credit risk models are calibrated based on internal data beginning in 2007. All borrowers and facilities are assigned an internal risk rating that must be reviewed at least once each year. External data such as rating agency default rates or loss databases are used to benchmark the parameters. Internal risk ratings (BRR and FRR) are key to portfolio monitoring and management, and are used to set exposur e limits and loan pricing. Internal risk ratings are also used in the calculation of regulatory capital, economic capital, and allowance for credit losses. Borrower Risk Rating and PD Each borrower is assigned a BRR that reflects the PD of the borrower using pr oprietary models and expert judgment. In assessing borrower risk, the Bank reviews the borrower’s competitive position, financial performance, economic, and industry trends, management quality, and access to funds. Under the IRB approaches, borrowers are grouped into BRR grades where a PD is calibrated for each BRR grade. Use of projections for model implied risk ratings is not permitted and BRRs may not incorporate a projected reversal, stabilization of negative trends, or the acceleration of existing positive trends. Historic financial results can however be sensitized to account for events that have occurred, or are about to occur, such as additional debt incurred by a borrower since the date of the last set of financial statements. In conducting an assessment of the BRR, all relevant and material information must be taken into account and the information being used must be current. Quantitative rating models are used to rank the expected through-the-cycle PD, and these models are segmented into categories based on industry and borrower size. The quantitative model output can be modified in some cases by expert judgment, as prescribed within the Bank’s credit policies. To calibrate PDs for each BRR band, the Bank computes yearly transition matrices based on annual cohorts and then estimates the average annual PD for each BRR. The PD is set at the average estimation level plus an appropriate adjustment to cover statistical and model uncertainty . The calibration process for PD is a through-the-cycle approach. TD’s 21-point BRR scale broadly aligns to external ratings as follows: Description Rating Category Standard & Poor’s Moody’s Investor Services Investment grade 0 to 1C AAA to AA- Aaa to Aa3 2A to 2C A+ to A- A1 to A3 3A to 3C BBB+ to BBB- Baa1 to Baa3 Non-investment grade 4A to 4C BB+ to BB- Ba1 to Ba3 5A to 5C B+ to B- B1 to B3 Watch and classified 6 to 8 CCC+ to CC and below Caa1 to Ca and below Impaired/default 9A to 9B Default Default Facility Risk Rating and LGD The FRR maps to LGD, with different models used based on industry and obligor size, and takes into account facility-specific characteristics such as collateral, seniority ranking of debt, loan structure, and borr ower enterprise value. Average LGD and the statistical uncertainty of LGD are estimated for each FRR grade. In some FRR models, the scar city of historical default events requires the model to output a rank-ordering which is then mapped through expert judgment to the quantitative LGD scale. Under the FIRB approach, LGDs are prescribed whereas the AIRB appr oach stipulates the use of downturn LGD, where the downturn period, as determined by internal and/or external experience, suggests higher than average loss rates or lower than average recovery. To reflect this, calibrated LGDs take into account both the statistical estimation uncertainty and the higher than average LGDs experienced during downturn periods. Exposure at Default The Bank calculates non-retail EAD by first measuring the drawn amount of a facility and then adding a potential incr eased utilization at default from the undrawn portion, if any. Usage Given Default (UGD) is measured as the percentage of undrawn exposure that would be expected to be drawn by a borrower defaulting in the next year, in addition to the amount that already has been drawn by the borrower. In the absence of credit mitigation effects or other details, the EAD is set at the drawn amount plus (estimated UGD x undrawn) for AIRB exposur e, or (prescribed UGD x undrawn) for FIRB exposures. BRR and drawn ratio up to one-year prior to default are predictors for UGD under the AIRB appr oach. Consequently, the UGD estimates are calibrated by BRR and drawn ratio, the latter representing the ratio of the drawn to authorized amounts. Historical UGD experience is studied for any downturn impacts, similar to the LGD downtur n analysis. The Bank has not found downturn UGD to be significantly different from average UGD, therefore the UGDs under AIRB are set at the average calibrated level, by drawn ratio and/or BRR, plus an appropriate adjustment for statistical and model uncertainty. UGDs under the FIRB approach are prescribed for relevant exposure classes. Credit Risk Exposures Subject to the Standardized Approach (SA) Currently the SA to credit risk is used for new portfolios, which are in the process of transitioning to IRB approaches, or exempted portfolios which are either immaterial or expected to wind down. The Bank primarily applies SA to certain segments within both the Retail and Non-retail portfolios. Under the SA, the exposure amounts are multiplied by risk weights prescribed by OSFI, based on the OSFI Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guidelines, to determine RWA. These risk weights are assigned according to certain factors including counterparty type, product type, and the nature/extent of credit risk mitigation. The Bank 90 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS uses external credit ratings, including Moody’s and S&P to determine the appropriate risk weight for its exposures to sovereigns and central banks, public sector entities (PSEs), banks (regulated DTIs and securities firms), and corporates. The Bank applies SA to certain retail portfolios, including Real Estate Secured Lending (RESL), where the assigned risk weight is primarily based on the exposure’s Loan-to-Value ratio and whether the exposure is categorized as income producing or general. Lower risk weights apply where approved credit risk mitigants exist. For off-balance sheet exposur es, specified credit conversion factors are used to convert the notional amount of the exposure into a credit equivalent amount. Derivative Exposures Credit risk on derivative financial instruments, also known as counterparty cr edit risk, is the risk of a financial loss occurring as a result of the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligation to the Bank. Derivative- related credit risks are subject to the same credit approval standards that the Bank uses for assessing loans. These standards include evaluating the creditworthiness of counterparties, measuring and monitoring exposures, including wrong-way risk exposures, and managing the size, diversification, and maturity structure of the portfolios. The Bank uses various qualitative and quantitative methods to measure and manage counterparty cr edit risk. These include statistical methods to measure the current and future potential risk, as well as ongoing stress testing to identify and quantify exposure under a range of adverse scenarios. The Bank establishes various limits to manage business volumes and concentrations. Risk Management independently measures and monitors counterparty credit risk relative to established credit policies and limits. As part of the credit risk monitoring process, management periodically reviews all exposures, including exposures resulting from derivative financial instruments to higher risk counterparties, and to assess the valuation of underlying financial instruments and the impact evolving market conditions may have on the Bank. To reduce credit risk exposure, the Bank employs mitigation strategies that include master netting agr eements, collateral pledging, central clearing houses and other credit risk mitigation techniques. Master netting agreements allow the Bank to offset and arrive at a net obligation amount, whereas collateral agreements allow the Bank to secure the Bank’s exposure. By taking the opposite position to each trade, central clearing houses also reduce bilateral credit risk. There are two types of wrong-way risk exposures, namely general and specific. General wrong-way risk arises when the PD of the counterparties moves in the same direction as a given market risk factor. Specific wrong- way risk arises when the exposure to a particular counterparty moves in the same direction as the PD of the counterparty due to the nature of the transactions entered into with that counterparty. These exposures require specific approval within the credit approval process. The Bank measures and manages specific wrong-way risk exposures in the same manner as direct loan obligations and controls them by way of approved credit facility limits. The Bank uses the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk to calculate the EAD amount, which is defined by OSFI as a multiple of the summation of r eplacement cost and potential future exposure, to estimate the risk and determine regulatory capital requirements for derivative exposures. Validation of the Credit Risk Rating System Credit risk rating systems and methodologies are independently validated on a regular basis to verify that they r emain accurate predictors of risk. The validation process includes the following considerations: • Risk parameter estimates – PDs, LGDs, and EADs are reviewed and updated against actual loss experience to verify that estimates continue to be reasonable predictors of potential loss. • Model performance – Estimates continue to be discriminatory, stable, and predictive. • Data quality – Data used in the risk rating system is accurate, appropriate, and sufficient. • Assumptions – Key assumptions underlying the development of the model remain valid for the current portfolio and environment. Risk Management verifies that the credit risk rating system complies with the Bank’ s Model Risk Policy. At least annually, the Risk Committee is informed of the performance of the credit risk rating system. The Risk Committee must approve any material changes to the Bank’s credit risk rating system. Credit Risk Mitigation The techniques the Bank uses to reduce or mitigate credit risk include written policies and pr ocedures to value and manage financial and non-financial security (collateral) and to review and negotiate netting agreements. The amount and type of collateral, and other credit risk mitigation techniques required, are based on the Bank’s own assessment of the borrower’s or counterparty’s credit quality and capacity to pay. In the Retail and Commercial banking businesses, security for loans is primarily non-financial and includes r esidential real estate, real estate under development, commercial real estate, automobiles, and other business assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets. In the Wholesale Banking business, a large portion of loans are to investment grade borrowers where no security is pledged. Non-investment grade borrowers typically pledge business assets in the same manner as commercial borrowers. Common standards across the Bank are used to value collateral, determine frequency of recalculation, and to document, register, perfect, and monitor collateral. The Bank also uses collateral, master netting agreements and central clearing houses to mitigate derivative counterparty exposur e. Security for derivative exposures is primarily financial and includes cash and negotiable securities issued by highly rated governments and investment grade issuers. This approach includes pre-defined discounts and procedures for the receipt, safekeeping, and release of pledged securities. In all but exceptional situations, the Bank secures collateral by taking possession and contr olling it in a jurisdiction where it can legally enforce its collateral rights. In exceptional situations and when demanded by the Bank’s counterparty, the Bank holds or pledges collateral with an acceptable third-party custodian. The Bank documents all such third-party arrangements with industry standard agreements. Occasionally, the Bank may take guarantees to reduce the risk in cr edit exposures. For credit risk exposures subject to the IRB approaches, the Bank only recognizes irrevocable guarantees for Commercial Banking and Wholesale Banking credit exposures that are provided by entities with a better risk rating than that of the borrower or counterparty to the transaction. The Bank makes use of credit derivatives to mitigate credit risk. The cr edit, legal, and other risks associated with these transactions are controlled through well-established procedures. The Bank’s policy is to enter into these transactions with investment grade financial institutions and transact on a collateralized basis. Credit risk to these counterparties is managed through the same approval, limit, and monitoring processes the Bank uses for all counterparties for which it has credit exposure. The Bank uses appraisals as well as valuations via automated valuation models (A VMs) to support property values when adjudicating loans collateralized by residential property. AVMs are computer-based tools used to estimate or validate the market value of residential property and uses market comparables and price trends for local market areas. The primary risk associated with the use of these tools is that the value of an individual property may vary significantly from the average for the market area. The Bank has specific risk management guidelines addressing the circumstances when they may be used, and processes to periodically validate AVMs including obtaining third-party appraisals. 91",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report outlines its comprehensive approach to managing credit risk across its retail and non-retail portfolios. The bank employs various models and strategies to assess and monitor credit risk, including the use of borrower and facility risk ratings (BRR and FRR), stress testing, and adherence to the Basel IRB framework for calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA). Retail exposures are managed using predictive credit scoring and are categorized into residential secured, qualifying revolving retail, and other retail, with risk parameters updated quarterly. Non-retail exposures are assessed individually using industry-specific models and expert judgment, with risk ratings influencing exposure limits and loan pricing. The bank also employs credit risk mitigation techniques such as collateral, netting agreements, and credit derivatives. Validation of credit risk models is conducted regularly to ensure accuracy and compliance with regulatory standards. Additionally, the bank uses the standardized approach for certain portfolios and derivative exposures, applying risk weights based on external credit ratings and other factors."

Gross credit risk exposure does not reflect the effects of credit risk mitigation and includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. On-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of outstanding loans, acceptances, non- trading securities, derivatives, and certain other repo-style transactions. Of f-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of undrawn commitments, guarantees, and certain other repo-style transactions. Gross credit risk exposures for the two approaches the Bank uses to measur e credit risk are included in the following table.

This table excludes securitization, equity, and other credit RWA. Other Credit Risk Exposures Non-trading Equity Exposures The Bank applies the standardized approach to calculate RWA on non- trading equity exposur es. Under the standardized approach, a 250% risk weight is applied to equity holdings with the exception of speculative unlisted equities that receive a 400% risk weight. Equity exposures to sovereigns and holdings made under legislated programs continue to follow the appropriate OSFI prescribed risk weights of 0%, 20% or 100%. Securitization Exposures Effective November 1, 2018, the Bank applies risk weights to all securitization exposur es under the revised securitization framework published by OSFI. The revised securitization framework includes a hierarchy of approaches to determine capital treatment, and transactions that meet the simple, transparent, and comparable requirements that are eligible for preferential capital treatment. The Bank uses Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) for qualified exposur es. Under SEC-IRBA, risk weights are determined using a loss coverage model that quantifies and monitors the level of risk. The SEC- IRBA also considers credit enhancements available for loss protection. For externally rated exposures that do not qualify for SEC-IRBA, the Bank uses an Exter nal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-ERBA). Risk weights are assigned to exposures using external ratings by external rating agencies, including Moody’s and S&P . The SEC-ERBA also takes into account additional factors, including the type of the rating (long-term or short-term), maturity, and the seniority of the position. For exposures that do not qualify for SEC-IRBA or SEC-ERBA, and are held by an ABCP issuing conduit, the Bank uses the Inter nal Assessment Approach (IAA). Under the IAA, the Bank considers all relevant risk factors in assessing the cr edit quality of these exposures, including those published by the Moody’s and S&P rating agencies. The Bank also uses loss coverage models and policies to quantify and monitor the level of risk, and facilitate its management. The Bank’s IAA process includes an assessment of the extent by which the enhancement available for loss protection provides coverage of expected losses. The levels of stressed coverage the Bank requires for each internal risk rating are consistent with the rating agencies’ published stressed factor requirements for their equivalent external ratings by asset class. Under the IAA, exposures are multiplied by OSFI prescribed risk weights to calculate RWA for capital purposes. For exposures that do not qualify for SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA or the IAA, the Bank uses the SA (SEC-SA). Under SEC-SA, the primary factors that determine the risk weights include the asset class of the underlying loans, the seniority of the position, the level of credit enhancements, and historical delinquency rates. Irrespective of the approach being used to determine the risk weights, all exposur es are assigned an internal risk rating based on the Bank’s assessment, which must be reviewed at least annually. The ratings scale TD uses corresponds to the long-term ratings scales used by the rating agencies. The Bank’s internal rating process is subject to all of the key elements and principles of the Bank’s risk gover nance structure, and is managed in the same way as outlined in this “Credit Risk” section. The Bank uses the results of the internal rating in all aspects of its credit risk management, including performance tracking, contr ol mechanisms, and management reporting. Market Risk Trading Market Risk is the risk of loss from financial instruments held in trading portfolios due to adverse movements in market factors. These market factors include interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and their respective volatilities. Non-Trading Market Risk is the risk of loss on the balance sheet or volatility in ear nings from non-trading activities such as asset-liability management or investments, due to adverse movements in market factors. These market factors are predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Bank is exposed to market risk in its trading and investment portfolios, as well as thr ough its non-trading activities. The Bank is an active participant in the market through its trading and investment portfolios, seeking to realize returns for the Bank through careful management of its positions and inventories. In the Bank’s non-trading activities, it is exposed to market risk through the everyday banking transactions that the Bank executes with its customers. The Bank complied with the Basel III market risk requirements as at October 31, 2023, using the Inter nal Models Approach. Starting fiscal 2024, the Bank plans to comply with the revised Basel III market risk requirements using the Standardized Approach. 92",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report provides an analysis of its gross credit risk exposure, which is the total exposure at the time of a loan default, measured before any credit risk mitigation. This exposure includes both on-balance sheet items like loans and derivatives, and off-balance sheet items like undrawn commitments and guarantees. The report details the bank's use of both the Standardized and Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approaches to measure credit risk, with total gross credit risk exposures amounting to CAD 2,154,437 million as of October 31, 2023, up from CAD 2,102,230 million in 2022.\n\nThe bank applies different risk weight approaches for non-trading equity and securitization exposures, including the Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA), External Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-ERBA), and Internal Assessment Approach (IAA), depending on the type of exposure and its qualifications. These approaches help determine the risk weights and capital requirements for various exposures.\n\nAdditionally, the report discusses market risk, which involves potential losses from adverse market movements affecting trading and non-trading portfolios. The bank manages these risks through active market participation and compliance with Basel III requirements. As of October 31, 2023, the bank used the Internal Models Approach for market risk but plans to adopt the Standardized Approach starting in fiscal 2024."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The overall objective of the Bank’s trading businesses is to provide wholesale banking services, including facilitation and liquidity, to clients of the Bank. The Bank must take on risk in order to provide effective service in markets where its clients trade. In particular, the Bank needs to hold inventory, act as principal to facilitate client transactions, and underwrite new issues. The Bank also trades in order to have in-depth knowledge of market conditions to provide the most efficient and effective pricing and service to clients, while balancing the risks inherent in its dealing activities. Primary responsibility for managing market risk in trading activities lies with Wholesale Banking, with oversight from Market Risk Control within Risk Management. The Market Risk Control Committee meets regularly to review the market risk profile and trading results of the Bank’s trading businesses. The committee is chaired by the Vice President, Head of Market Risk, and includes Wholesale Banking senior management. There were no significant reclassifications between trading and non- trading books during the year ended October 31, 2023. Market risk plays a key part in the assessment of trading business strategies. The process for the Bank to launch new trading initiatives, or expand existing ones, involves an assessment of risk with respect to the Bank’s risk appetite and business expertise and an assessment of the appropriate infrastructure required to monitor, control, and manage the risk. The Trading Market Risk Framework outlines the management of trading market risk and incorporates risk appetite, risk governance structures, risk identification, risk measurement, and risk control. The Trading Market Risk Framework is maintained by Risk Management and supports alignment with the Bank’s risk appetite for trading market risk. Trading Limits The Bank sets trading limits that are consistent with the approved business strategy for each business and its tolerance for the associated market risk, aligned to its market risk appetite. In setting limits, the Bank takes into account market volatility, market liquidity, organizational experience, and business strategy. Limits are prescribed at the Wholesale Banking level in aggregate, as well as at more granular levels. The core market risk limits are based on the key risk drivers in the business and includes notional, credit spread, yield curve shift, price, and volatility limits. Another primary measure of trading limits is VaR, which the Bank uses to monitor and control overall risk levels and to calculate the regulatory capital required for market risk in trading activities. VaR measures the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of time. At the end of each day, risk positions are compared with risk limits, and any excesses are reported in accordance with established market risk policies and procedures. Calculating VaR The Bank computes total VaR on a daily basis by combining the General Market Risk (GMR) and Idiosyncratic Debt Specific Risk (IDSR) associated with the Bank’s trading positions. GMR is determined by creating a distribution of potential changes to the market value of the current portfolio using historical simulation. The Bank values the current portfolio using the market price and rate changes of the most recent 259 trading days for equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity products. GMR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. A one-day holding period is used for GMR calculation. IDSR measures idiosyncratic (single-name) credit spread risk for credit exposures in the trading portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. The IDSR model is based on the historical behaviour of five-year idiosyncratic credit spreads. Similar to GMR, IDSR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. IDSR is measured for a ten-day holding period. The following graph discloses daily one-day VaR usage and trading net revenue, reported on a TEB, within Wholesale Banking. Trading net revenue includes trading income and net interest income related to positions within the Bank’s market risk capital trading books. For the year ending October 31, 2023, there were 18 days of trading losses and trading net revenue was positive for 93% of the trading days, reflecting normal trading activity. Losses in the year did not exceed VaR on any trading day.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS VaR is a valuable risk measure but it should be used in the context of its limitations, for example: • VaR uses historical data to estimate future events, which limits its forecasting abilities; • it does not provide information on losses beyond the selected confidence level; and • it assumes that all positions can be liquidated during the holding period used for VaR calculation. The Bank continuously improves its VaR methodologies and incorporates new risk measures in line with market conventions, industry practices, and r egulatory requirements. In 2023, the Bank implemented infrastructure enhancements to adapt to the market wide Benchmark Rate Reforms. To mitigate some of the shortcomings of VaR, the Bank uses additional metrics designed for risk management and capital purposes. These include Stressed V aR, Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), Stress Testing, and sensitivities to various market risk factors. Calculating Stressed VaR (SVaR) In addition to VaR, the Bank also calculates Stressed VaR, which includes Stressed GMR and Str essed IDSR. Stressed VaR is designed to measure the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of stressed market conditions. Str essed VaR is determined using similar techniques and assumptions as GMR and IDSR VaR. However, instead of using the most recent 259 trading days (one year), the Bank uses a selected year of stressed market conditions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Stressed VaR was calculated using the one-year period that includes the 2008 financial crisis. The appropriate historical one-year period to use for Stressed VaR is determined on a regular basis. Calculating the Incremental Risk Charge The IRC is applied to all instruments in the trading book subject to migration and default risk. Migration risk represents the risk of changes in the cr edit ratings of the Bank’s exposures. The Bank applies a Monte Carlo simulation with a one-year horizon and a 99.9% confidence level to determine IRC, which is consistent with regulatory requirements. IRC is based on a “constant level of risk” assumption, which requires banks to assign a liquidity horizon to positions that are subject to IRC. The following table presents the end of year, average, high, and low usage of TD’s portfolio metrics. TABLE 44 PORTFOLIO MARKET RISK MEASURES | (millions of Canadian dollars) 2023 2022 As at Average High Low As at Average High Low Interest rate risk $ 21.1 $ 24.9 $ 44.2 $ 12.2 $ 15.3 $ 21.2 $ 41.1 $ 9.8 Credit spread risk 31.5 31.6 41.9 22.5 35.6 23.0 41.0 8.0 Equity risk 6.0 9.4 15.8 5.7 10.6 12.8 24.3 7.8 Foreign exchange risk 2.1 3.5 9.7 1.0 4.8 2.4 7.5 0.6 Commodity risk 2.9 4.8 11.7 2.3 12.1 5.8 13.4 2.9 Idiosyncratic debt specific risk 28.4 33.2 57.2 20.3 60.0 36.8 60.9 17.8 Diversification effect1 (57.4) (62.6) n/m2 n/m (69.4) (56.8) n/m n/m Total Value-at-Risk (one-day) 34.6 44.8 69.6 30.1 69.0 45.2 76.0 21.8 Stressed Value-at-Risk (one-day) 85.5 55.8 85.5 41.5 74.0 77.5 100.0 55.7 Incremental Risk Capital Charge (one-year) 162.0 151.4 195.8 121.7 176.4 260.3 418.8 149.4 1 The aggregate VaR is less than the sum of the VaR of the different risk types due to risk offsets resulting from portfolio diversification. 2 Not meaningful. It is not meaningful to compute a diversification effect because the high and low may occur on different days for different risk types. Market volatility subsided across most asset classes in 2023 however concerns persist related to ongoing geopolitical tensions, elevated inflationary pressure and further interest rate hikes in a prolonged high rate environment. The Bank has managed market risk by maintaining stable risk exposures, with daily VaR r emaining within approved limits during the year. Average VaR was relatively stable year-over-year. Average Stressed VaR decr eased year-over-year due to position changes in fixed income instruments, coupled with narrowing credit spreads. Average IRC decreased year-over-year due to changes in bond positions. Validation of VaR Model The Bank uses a back-testing process to compare the actual and theoretical pr ofit and losses to VaR to verify that they are consistent with the statistical results of the VaR model. The theoretical profit or loss is generated using the daily price movements on the assumption that there is no change in the composition of the portfolio. Validation of the IRC model must follow a different approach since the one-year horizon and 99.9% confidence level preclude standard back-testing techniques. Instead, key parameters of the IRC model such as transition and correlation matrices are subject to independent validation by benchmarking against external study results or through analysis using internal or external data. Stress Testing The Bank’s trading business is subject to an overall global stress test limit. In addition, global businesses have stress test limits, and each br oad risk class has an overall stress test threshold. Stress scenarios are designed to model extreme economic events, replicate worst-case historical experiences, or introduce severe, but plausible, hypothetical changes in key market risk factors. The stress testing program includes scenarios developed using actual historical market data during periods of market disruption, in addition to hypothetical scenarios developed by Risk Management. Stress test are produced and reviewed regularly. The events the Bank has modelled include the 1987 equity market crash, the 1998 Russian debt default crisis, the aftermath of September 11, 2001, the 2007 ABCP crisis, the credit crisis of Fall 2008, the Brexit r eferendum of June 2016, and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. The Bank is also exposed to market risk arising from its investment portfolio and other non-trading portfolios. Risk Management reviews and appr oves policies and procedures, which are established to monitor, measure, and mitigate these risks. Structural (Non-Trading) Market Risk Structural (Non-Trading) Market Risk deals with managing the market risks of TD’s traditional banking activities. This generally reflects the market risks arising from personal and commercial banking products (loans and deposits) as well as related funding, investments and HQLA. It does not include exposures from TD’s Wholesale Banking or Insurance businesses. Structural market risks primarily include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. 95",

In 2023, the bank enhanced its infrastructure to adapt to Benchmark Rate Reforms and used the 2008 financial crisis as a reference for Stressed VaR calculations. The report notes a decrease in average Stressed VaR and IRC due to changes in fixed income positions and credit spreads. The bank conducts back-testing to validate its VaR model and uses stress testing to simulate extreme economic events. Market volatility decreased in 2023, but concerns remain over geopolitical tensions and inflation. The bank manages market risk through stable exposures and adherence to approved limits. Additionally, structural market risks from traditional banking activities, such as interest rate and foreign exchange risks, are monitored and managed separately from trading activities."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS WHO MANAGES STRUCTURAL (NON-TRADING) MARKET RISK The TBSM group measures and manages the market risks of the Bank’s non-trading banking activities outside of TD’s Wholesale Banking and Insurance businesses, with oversight fr om the ALCO. The Market Risk Control function provides independent oversight, governance, and control over these market risks. The Risk Committee reviews and approves key non-trading market risk policies, and monitors the Bank’s positions and compliance with these policies through regular reporting and updates from senior management. HOW TD MANAGES STRUCTURAL (NON-TRADING) Non-trading interest rate risk is viewed as a non-productive risk as it has the potential to incr ease earnings volatility and generate losses without providing long run expected value. As a result, TBSM’s mandate is to structure the asset and liability positions of the balance sheet in order to achieve a target profile that controls the impact of changes in interest rates on the Bank’s net interest income and economic value to be consistent with the Bank’s risk appetite. Managing Structural Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the impact that changes in interest rates could have on the Bank’ s margins, earnings, and economic value. Interest rate risk management is designed to generate stable and predictable earnings over time. The Bank has adopted a disciplined hedging approach to manage the net interest income from its asset and liability positions. Key aspects of this approach are: • Evaluating and managing the impact of rising or falling interest rates on net interest income and economic value, and developing strategies to manage overall sensitivity to rates across varying interest rate scenarios; • Modelling the expected impact of customer behaviour on TD’s products (e.g., how actively customers exercise embedded options, such as prepaying a loan or redeeming a deposit before its maturity date); • Assigning target-modelled maturity profiles for non-maturity assets, liabilities, and equity; • Measuring the margins of TD’s banking products on a fully-hedged basis, including the impact of financial options that are granted to customers; and • Developing and implementing strategies to stabilize net interest income from all retail and commercial banking products. The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk from “mismatched positions” when asset and liability principal and interest cash flows have dif ferent interest payment, repricing or maturity dates. The Bank measures this risk based on an assessment of: contractual cash flows, product embedded optionality, customer behaviour expectations and the modelled maturity profiles for non-maturity products. To manage this risk, the Bank primarily uses financial derivatives, wholesale investments, funding instruments, and other capital market alternatives. The Bank also measures its exposure to non-maturity liabilities, such as cor e deposits, by assessing interest rate elasticity and balance permanence using historical data and business judgment. Fluctuations of non-maturity deposits can occur because of factors such as interest rate movements, equity market movements, and changes to customer liquidity preferences. Banking product optionality, whether from freestanding options such as mortgage rate commitments or options embedded within loans and deposits, expose the Bank to a significant financial risk. To manage these exposur es, the Bank purchases options or uses a dynamic hedging process designed to replicate the payoff of a purchased option. • Rate Commitments: The Bank measures its exposure from freestanding mortgage rate commitment options using an expected funding profile based on historical experience. Customers’ propensity to fund, and their preference for fixed or floating rate mortgage products, is influenced by factors such as market mortgage rates, house prices, and seasonality. • Asset Prepayment and other Embedded Options: The Bank models its exposure to written options embedded in some of its products, based on analyses of customer behaviour. Examples of this are the right to prepay residential mortgage loans, and the right to early redeem some term deposit products. For mortgages, econometric models are used to model prepayments and the effects of prepayment behaviour to the Bank. In general, mortgage prepayments are also affected by factors such as mortgage age, house prices, and GDP growth. The combined impacts from these parameters are also assessed to determine a core liquidation speed which is independent of market incentives. A similar analysis is undertaken for other products with embedded optionality. Structural Interest Rate Risk Measures The primary measures for this risk are Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Inter est Income Sensitivity (NIIS). The EVE Sensitivity measures the impact of a specified interest rate shock to the net pr esent value of the Bank’s banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items. It reflects a measurement of the potential present value impact on shareholders’ equity without an assumed term profile for the management of the Bank’s own equity and excludes product margins. The NIIS measures the NII change over a twelve-month horizon for a specified change in inter est rates for banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items assuming a constant balance sheet over the period. The Bank’s Market Risk policy sets overall limits on the structural interest rate risk measur es. These limits are periodically reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee. In addition to the Board policy limits, book-level risk limits for the Bank’s management of non-trading interest rate risk are set by Risk Management. Exposures against these limits are routinely monitored and reported, and breaches of the Board limits, if any, are escalated to both the ALCO and the Risk Committee. The following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decr ease in interest rates on the Bank’s EVE and NII. Interest rate floors are applied by currency to the decrease in rates such that they do not exceed expected lower bounds, with the most material currencies set to a floor of -25 bps.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS As at October 31, 2023, an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase in interest rates would have had a negative impact to the Bank’s EVE of $2,211 million, an increase of $715 million from last year, and a positive impact to the Bank’s NII of $920 million, a decrease of $293 million from last year. An immediate and sustained 100 bps decrease in interest rates would have had a positive impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,599 million, an increase of $497 million from last year, and a negative impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,099 million, a decrease of $282 million from last year. The year-over-year increase in both up and down shock EVE Sensitivity is due to an increase in the interest rate sensitivity of the Bank’s investment portfolio in the U.S. Region, and the increased sensitivity of net assets funded by equity. The year-over-year decrease in both up and down shock NIIS is primarily due to deposit attrition, changes in deposit composition, and Treasury hedging activity. As at October 31, 2023, reported EVE and NII Sensitivities remain within the Bank’s risk appetite and established Board limits. Managing Non-trading Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk refers to losses that could result from changes in for eign-currency exchange rates. Assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies create foreign exchange risk. The Bank is exposed to non-trading foreign exchange risk primarily from its investments in for eign operations. When the Bank’s foreign currency assets are greater or less than its liabilities in that currency, they create a foreign currency open position. An adverse change in foreign exchange rates can impact the Bank’s reported net income and shareholders’ equity, and also its capital ratios. In order to minimize the impact of an adverse foreign exchange rate change on certain capital ratios, the Bank’ s net investments in foreign operations are hedged so certain capital ratios change by no more than an acceptable amount for a given change in foreign exchange rates. The Bank does not generally hedge the earnings of foreign subsidiaries which results in changes to the Bank’s consolidated earnings when relevant foreign exchange rates change. As at October 31, 2022, the Bank executed foreign exchange hedges to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange volatility to closing capital of the First Horizon acquisition. These hedges wer e unwound following the announcement on May 4, 2023 by the Bank and First Horizon that they had entered into a mutual agreement to terminate the previously announced merger agreement. Other Non-trading Market Risks Other structural market risks monitored on a regular basis include: • Basis Risk – The Bank is exposed to risks related to the difference in various market indices. • Equity Risk – The Bank is exposed to non-trading equity risk from investment securities designated at FVOCI, equity-linked guaranteed investment certificate product offerings and share-based compensation plans where certain employees are awarded share units equivalent to the Bank’s common shares as compensation for services provided to the Bank. These share units are recorded as a liability over the vesting period and revalued at each reporting period until settled in cash, and changes in the Bank’s share price can impact non-interest expenses. The Bank uses equity derivative instruments to manage its non-trading equity price risk. Managing Investment Portfolios The Bank manages a securities portfolio that is integrated into the overall asset and liability management pr ocess. The securities portfolio is comprised of high-quality, low-risk securities and managed in a manner appropriate to the attainment of the following goals: (1) to generate a targeted credit of funds to deposit balances that are in excess of loan balances; (2) to provide a sufficient pool of liquid assets to meet deposit and loan fluctuations and overall liquidity management objectives; (3) to provide eligible securities to meet collateral and cash management requirements; and (4) to manage the target interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet. The Risk Committee reviews and approves the Enterprise Investment Policy that sets out limits for the Bank’s investment portfolio. In addition, the Wholesale Banking and Insurance businesses also hold investments that are managed separately. As previously noted, the Bank’s approach to structural (non-trading) market risk is designed to generate stable and pr edictable earnings over time, regardless of cash flow mismatches and the exercise of options granted to customers. This approach also creates margin certainty on loan and deposit profitability as they are booked. Despite this approach however, the Bank’s NIM is subject to change over time for the following reasons (among others): • Differences in margins earned on new and renewing products relative to the margin previously earned on matured products; • Weighted-average margin impact from changes in business and product mix; • Changes in the basis between certain market indices; • The lag in changing product prices in response to changes in market interest rates, including rate-sensitive deposit pricing; • Changes from the repricing of hedging strategies to manage the investment profile of the Bank’s non-rate sensitive deposits; and • Margin changes from the portion of the Bank’s deposits that are non-rate sensitive but not expected to be longer term in nature, resulting in a shorter term investment profile and higher sensitivity to short-term rates. The general level of interest rates will affect the return the Bank generates on its modelled maturity pr ofile for core non-rate sensitive deposits and the investment profile for its net equity position as it evolves over time. The general level of interest rates is also a key driver of some modelled option exposures, and will affect the cost of hedging such exposures. The Bank’s approach to managing these factors tends to moderate their impact over time, resulting in a more stable and predictable earnings stream. Operational Risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or technology or from human activities or from external events. This definition includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational risk. Operational risk is inherent in all of the Bank’s business activities, including the practices and contr ols used to manage other risks such as credit, market, and liquidity risk. Failure to manage operational risk can result in financial loss (direct or indirect), reputational harm, or regulatory censure and penalties. The Bank seeks to actively mitigate and manage operational risk in order to cr eate and sustain shareholder value, successfully execute the Bank’s business strategies, operate efficiently, and provide reliable, secure, and convenient access to financial services. The Bank maintains a formal enterprise-wide operational risk management framework that emphasizes a strong risk management and internal control culture throughout TD. In fiscal 2023, operational risk losses remained within the Bank’s operational risk appetite. Refer to Note 26 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on material legal or r egulatory actions. 97",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Interest Rate Sensitivity**: A 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates would negatively impact the Bank's Economic Value of Equity (EVE) by $2,211 million, an increase from the previous year, while positively impacting Net Interest Income (NII) by $920 million, a decrease from last year. Conversely, a 100 bps decrease would positively impact EVE by $1,599 million and negatively impact NII by $1,099 million. These changes are attributed to increased interest rate sensitivity in the U.S. investment portfolio and net assets funded by equity.\n\n2. **Foreign Exchange Risk**: The Bank manages non-trading foreign exchange risk primarily from its foreign operations. It hedges net investments to minimize adverse impacts on capital ratios but does not hedge earnings from foreign subsidiaries, leading to potential changes in consolidated earnings due to exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n3. **Market Risks**: The Bank monitors structural market risks, including basis risk and equity risk. It uses equity derivatives to manage non-trading equity price risk and maintains a securities portfolio to manage liquidity and interest rate risk.\n\n4. **Operational Risk**: TD Bank actively manages operational risk through a comprehensive framework, maintaining losses within its risk appetite. This includes managing risks from internal processes, technology, and external events.\n\nOverall, the Bank's strategies aim to maintain stable and predictable earnings while managing various financial risks within its established risk appetite."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Operational Risk Management is an independent function that owns and maintains the Bank’ s Operational Risk Management Framework. This framework sets out the enterprise-wide governance processes, policies, and practices to identify, assess, measure, control, monitor, escalate, report, and communicate on operational risk. Operational Risk Management is designed to provide appropriate monitoring and reporting of the Bank’s operational risk profile and exposures to senior management through the OROC, the ERMC, and the Risk Committee. In addition to the framework, Operational Risk Management owns and maintains, or has oversight of, the Bank’ s operational risk policies including those that govern business continuity and crisis management, third-party risk management, data risk management, financial crime and fraud risk management, change governance, and technology and cyber security risk management. The senior management of individual business units and corporate areas is r esponsible for the day-to-day management of operational risk following the Bank’s established operational risk management framework, policies and the three lines of defence model. An independent risk management oversight function supports each business segment and corporate area and monitors and challenges the implementation and use of the operational risk management framework programs according to the nature and scope of the operational risks inherent in the area. The senior executives in each business unit and corporate area participate in a Risk Management Committee that oversees operational risk management issues and initiatives. Ultimately, every employee has a role to play in managing operational risk. In addition to policies and pr ocedures guiding employee activities, training is available to all staff regarding specific types of operational risks and their role in helping to protect the interests and assets of the Bank. The Operational Risk Management Framework outlines the internal risk and contr ol structure to manage operational risk and includes the operational risk appetite, governance processes, and policies. The Operational Risk Management Framework supports alignment with the Bank’s ERF and risk appetite. The framework incorporates sound industry practices and meets regulatory requirements. Key components of the framework include: Governance and Policy Management reporting and organizational structures emphasize accountability , ownership, and effective oversight of each business unit and each corporate area’s operational risk exposures. In addition, the expectations of the Risk Committee and senior management for managing operational risk are set out by enterprise-wide policies and practices. Risk and Control Self-Assessment Internal controls are one of the primary methods of safeguarding the Bank’ s employees, customers, assets, and information, and in preventing and detecting errors and fraud. Management undertakes comprehensive assessments of key risk exposures and the internal controls in place to reduce or offset these risks. Senior management reviews the results of these evaluations to determine that risk management and internal controls are effective, appropriate, and compliant with the Bank’s policies. Operational Risk Event Monitoring To reduce the Bank’s exposure to future loss, it is critical that the Bank r emains aware of and responds to its own and industry operational risks. The Bank’s policies and processes require that operational risk events be identified, tracked and reported to the appropriate level of management to facilitate the Bank’s analysis and management of its risks and inform the assessment of suitable corrective and preventative action. The Bank also reviews, analyzes, and benchmarks itself against operational risk losses that have occurred at other financial institutions using information acquired through recognized industry data providers. Scenario Analysis Scenario Analysis is a systematic and repeatable process of obtaining expert business and risk opinion to derive assessments of the likelihood and potential loss estimates of high impact operational events that ar e unexpected and outside the normal course of business. The Bank applies this practice to meet risk measurement and risk management objectives. The process includes the use of relevant external operational loss event data along with the Bank’s internal loss data and risk outlook that is assessed considering the Bank’s operational risk profile and control structure. The program raises awareness and educates business and corporate segments regarding existing and emerging risks, which may result in the identification and implementation of new scenarios and risk mitigation action plans to minimize tail risk. Risk Reporting Risk Management regularly monitors risk-related measures and the risk pr ofile throughout the Bank to report to senior management and the Risk Committee. Operational risk measures are systematically tracked, assessed, and reported to promote management accountability and direct the appropriate level of attention to current and emerging issues. Insurance TD’s Corporate Insurance team, with oversight from TD Risk Management, utilizes insurance and other risk transfer arrangements to mitigate and r educe potential future losses related to operational risk. Risk Management includes oversight of the effective use of insurance aligned with the Bank’s risk management strategy and risk appetite. Insurance terms and provisions, including types and amounts of coverage, are regularly assessed so that the Bank’s tolerance for risk and, where applicable, statutory requirements are satisfied. The management process includes conducting regular in-depth risk and financial analysis and identifying opportunities to transfer elements of the Bank’s risk to third parties where appropriate. The Bank transacts with external insurers that satisfy its minimum financial rating requirements. Technology and Cyber Security The Bank’s business and operations use technology and information to cr eate and support new markets, competitive products, delivery channels, as well as other business operations and opportunities. The Bank manages technology and cyber security risks to support adequate and proper day-to-day operations; and pr otect against unauthorized access to the Bank’s technology, infrastructure, systems, information, and data. To enable this, the Bank actively monitors, manages, and continues to enhance its ability to mitigate these risks through enterprise-wide programs and industry-accepted cyber threat management practices to enable rapid detection and response. The Bank’s Platforms and Technology Risk and Compliance Committee pr ovides senior executive oversight, direction and guidance regarding management of risks relating to cyber security, including cyber terrorism/ activism, cyber fraud, cyber espionage, extortion, identity theft and data theft. This Committee endorses actions and makes recommendations to the CEO and the ERMC as appropriate, including in some instances, supporting onward recommendations to the Risk Committee and the Board of Directors. Together with the Bank’s Operational Risk Management Framework, technology and cyber security programs also include enhanced resiliency planning and testing, as well as disciplined technology change management practices. Data Management The Bank’s data assets are governed and managed to preserve value and support business objectives. Inconsistent or inadequate data gover nance and management practices may compromise the Bank’s data and information assets which could result in financial and reputational impacts. The Bank’s Enterprise Data Governance Office, Corporate and Technology partners develop and implement enterprise-wide standards and practices that describe how data and information assets are created, used, or maintained on behalf of the Bank. 98",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report outlines its comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework, which is designed to identify, assess, measure, control, monitor, and report operational risks across the enterprise. This framework ensures alignment with the bank's risk appetite and regulatory requirements, incorporating industry best practices. Key components include governance and policy management, risk and control self-assessment, operational risk event monitoring, scenario analysis, risk reporting, and insurance. The framework emphasizes accountability and effective oversight, with senior management and business units responsible for day-to-day risk management. The bank also focuses on technology and cyber security, employing enterprise-wide programs to mitigate risks and enhance resiliency. Data management is governed to preserve value and support business objectives, with standards developed by the Enterprise Data Governance Office. Overall, the framework supports proactive risk management and aligns with the bank's strategic goals."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Business Continuity and Crisis Management The Bank maintains an enterprise-wide business continuity and crisis management pr ogram that supports management’s ability to operate the Bank’s businesses and operations (including providing customers access to products and services) in the event of a business disruption incident. All areas of the Bank are required to maintain and regularly test business continuity plans to maintain resilience and facilitate the continuity and recovery of business operations. This program is supported by formal crisis management measures so that the appropriate level of leadership, oversight and management is applied to incidents affecting the Bank. Third-Party Management A third-party supplier/vendor is an entity that supplies products, services or other business activities, functions or pr ocesses to or on behalf of the Bank. While these relationships bring benefits to the Bank’s businesses and customers, the Bank also needs to manage and minimize any risks related to the activity. The Bank does this through an enterprise third-party risk management program that is designed to manage third-party activities throughout the life cycle of an arrangement and provide a level of risk management and senior management oversight which is appropriate to the size, risk, and criticality of the third-party arrangement. Change and Delivery The Bank has established a disciplined approach to delivering change acr oss the enterprise coordinated by the Enterprise Project Delivery Excellence and Enterprise Portfolio Management and Governance groups. This approach involves senior management governance and oversight of the Bank’s change portfolio and leverages leading industry practices to guide the Bank’s use of standardized delivery methodologies, defined accountabilities and capabilities, and portfolio reporting and management tools to support successful delivery. Fraud Management The Bank develops and implements enterprise-wide fraud management strategies, policies, and practices that ar e designed to minimize the number, size and scope of fraudulent activities perpetrated against it. The Bank employs prevention, detection and monitoring capabilities across the enterprise that are designed to help protect customers, shareholders, and employees from increasingly sophisticated fraud risk. Fraud risk is managed by communicating appropriate policies, procedures, employee education in fraud risks, and monitoring activity to help maintain adherence to the Fraud Risk Management Framework. The Fraud Risk Management Framework describes the governance, policies, and processes that the Bank’s businesses employ to proactively manage and govern fraud risk within the Bank’s risk appetite which is embedded in the Bank’s day to day operations and culture. The Bank has also established an advocacy and advisory program to advocate for strong fraud risk awareness and effective controls across the enterprise and a dedicated fraud risk appetite measure within its operational risk appetite to better monitor and assess fraud impacts across the enterprise. Operational Risk Capital Measurement The Bank’s operational risk capital is determined using the Basel III Standar dized Approach (SA) which is based on a Business Indicator Component (BIC), a financial-statement-based proxy for operational risk and an Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM), which is based on average historical losses and the BIC. ILM is derived using operational risk losses, net of recoveries, over the previous ten years, and BIC is derived using financial information over the previous three years. The operational risk capital is the product of the BIC and the ILM. Model Risk Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences arising from decisions based on incorrect or misused models and other estimation approaches and their outputs. It can lead to financial loss, reputational risk, or incorrect business and strategic decisions. Primary accountability for the management of model risk resides with the senior management of individual businesses with r espect to the models they use. The Model Risk Governance Committee provides oversight of governance, risk, and control matters, by providing a platform to guide, challenge, and advise decision makers and model owners in model risk related matters. Model Risk Management monitors and reports on existing and emerging model risks, and provides periodic assessments to senior management, Risk Management, the Risk Committee, and regulators on the state of model risk at TD and alignment with the Bank’s Model Risk Appetite. The Risk Committee approves the Bank’s Model Risk Management Framework and Model Risk Policy. The Bank manages model risk in accordance with management approved model risk policies and supervisory guidance which encompass the life cycle of a model, including pr oof of concept, development, validation, implementation, usage, and ongoing model monitoring. The Bank’s Model Risk Management Framework also captures key processes that may be partially or wholly qualitative, or based on expert judgment. Segments identify the need for a new model and are responsible for model development and documentation accor ding to the Bank’s policies and standards. During model development, controls with respect to code generation, acceptance testing, and usage are established and documented to a level of detail and comprehensiveness matching their model risk rating. Once models are implemented, model owners are responsible for ongoing monitoring and usage in accordance with the Bank’s Model Risk Policy. In cases where a model is deemed obsolete or unsuitable for its originally intended purposes, it is decommissioned in accordance with the Bank’s policies. Model Risk Management provides oversight, maintains a centralized inventory of all models as defined in the Bank’ s Model Risk Policy, validates and approves new and existing models on a pre-determined schedule depending on the model risk rating, sets model monitoring standards, and provides training to all stakeholders. The validation process varies in rigour, depending on the model risk rating, but at a minimum contains a detailed determination of: • the conceptual soundness of model methodologies and underlying quantitative and qualitative assumptions; • the risk associated with a model based on intrinsic risk, materiality and criticality; • the sensitivity of model-to-model assumptions and changes in data inputs including stress testing; and • the limitations of a model and the compensating risk mitigation mechanisms in place to address the limitations. When appropriate, validation includes a benchmarking exercise which may include the building of an independent model based on an alter native modelling approach. The results of the benchmark model are compared to the model being assessed to validate the appropriateness of the model’s methodology and its use. As with traditional model approaches, machine- learning models are also subject to the same rigorous standards and risk management practices. At the conclusion of the validation process, a model will either be appr oved for use or will be rejected and require redevelopment or other courses of action. Models identified as obsolete or no longer appropriate for use, due to changes in industry practice, the business environment or Bank strategies, are subject to decommissioning. The Bank has policies and procedures in place designed to properly discern models fr om non-models, and the level of independent challenge and oversight corresponds to the materiality and complexity of models. 99",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report outlines several key areas of focus in its management practices:\n\n1. **Business Continuity and Crisis Management**: The bank has an enterprise-wide program to ensure business operations continue during disruptions. This includes regular testing of business continuity plans and formal crisis management measures to provide appropriate leadership and oversight during incidents.\n\n2. **Third-Party Management**: TD Bank manages risks associated with third-party suppliers through a comprehensive risk management program, ensuring oversight and risk management are proportional to the size and criticality of the third-party arrangements.\n\n3. **Change and Delivery**: The bank employs a structured approach to managing change across the organization, coordinated by specific governance groups.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Insurance Risk Insurance risk is the risk of financial loss due to actual experience emerging differently from expectations in insurance product pricing and/or design, underwriting, reinsurance protection, and claims or reserving either at the inception of an insurance or reinsurance contract, during the lifecycle of the claim or at the valuation date. Unfavourable experience could emerge due to adverse fluctuations in timing, actual size, frequency of claims (for example, driven by non-life premium risk, non-life reserving risk, catastrophic risk, mortality risk, morbidity risk, and longevity risk), or policyholder behaviour. Insurance contracts provide financial protection by transferring insured risks to the issuer in exchange for pr emiums. The Bank is engaged in insurance businesses relating to property and casualty insurance, life and health insurance, and reinsurance, through various subsidiaries; it is through these businesses that the Bank is exposed to insurance risk. Senior management within the insurance business units has primary r esponsibility for managing insurance risk with oversight by the CRO for Insurance, who reports into the Bank’s Risk Management Group. The Bank’s Audit Committee and the Bank’s Corporate Governance Committee r espectively act as the Audit and Conduct review committees for the Canadian insurance company subsidiaries. The insurance company subsidiaries also have their own boards of directors who provide additional risk management oversight. The Bank’s risk governance practices are designed to support independent oversight and contr ol of risk within the insurance business. The TD Insurance Risk Committee and its subcommittees provide critical oversight of the risk management activities within the insurance business and monitor compliance with insurance risk policies. The Bank’s Insurance Risk Management Framework and Insurance Risk Policy collectively outline the internal risk and control structure to manage insurance risk and include risk appetite, policies, processes, as well as limits and governance. These documents are maintained by Risk Management and support alignment with the Bank’s risk appetite for insurance risk. The assessment of policy (premium and claims) liabilities is central to the insurance operation. The Bank establishes r eserves to cover estimated future payments (including loss adjustment expenses) on all claims or terminations/surrenders of premium arising from insurance contracts underwritten. The reserves cannot be established with complete certainty, and represent management’s best estimate for future payments. As such, the Bank regularly monitors estimates against actual and emerging experience and adjusts reserves as appropriate if experience emerges differently than anticipated. Claim and premium liabilities are governed by the Bank’s general insurance and life and health reserving policies. Sound product design is an essential element of managing risk. The Bank’s exposur e to insurance risk is mostly short-term in nature as the principal underwriting risk relates to personal automobile and home insurance and small commercial insurance. Insurance market cycles, as well as changes in insurance legislation, the r egulatory environment, judicial environment, trends in court awards, climate patterns, pandemics or other applicable public health emergencies, and the economic environment may impact the performance of the insurance business. Consistent pricing policies and underwriting standards are maintained. There is also exposure to concentration risk associated with general insurance and life and health coverage. Exposur e to insurance risk concentration is managed through established underwriting guidelines, limits, and authorization levels that govern the acceptance of risk. Concentration of insurance risk is also mitigated through the purchase of reinsurance. The insurance business’ reinsurance programs are governed by catastrophe and reinsurance risk management policies. Strategies are in place to manage the risk to the Bank’s reinsurance business. Underwriting risk on business assumed is managed thr ough a policy that limits exposure to certain types of business and countries. The vast majority of reinsurance treaties are annually renewable, which minimizes long-term risk. Pandemic exposure is reviewed and estimated annually within the reinsurance business to manage concentration risk. Liquidity Risk The risk of having insufficient cash or collateral to meet financial obligations and an inability to, in a timely manner, raise funding or monetize assets at a non-distressed price. Financial obligations can arise from deposit withdrawals, debt maturities, commitments to provide credit or liquidity support or the need to pledge additional collateral. TD’S LIQUIDITY RISK APPETITE The Bank applies an established set of practices and protocols for managing its potential exposur e to liquidity risk. The Bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under a combined bank-specific and market-wide stress scenario, and a minimum buffer over regulatory requirements prescribed by the OSFI LAR guidelines. Under the LAR guidelines, Canadian banks are required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at the minimum of 100% other than during periods of financial stress and to maintain a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at the minimum of 100%. The Bank’s funding program emphasizes maximizing deposits as a core source of funding, and having ready access to wholesale funding markets across diversified terms, funding types, and currencies that is designed to ensure low exposure to a sudden contraction of wholesale funding capacity and to minimize structural liquidity gaps. The Bank also maintains a contingency funding plan to enhance preparedness for recovery from potential liquidity stress events. The Bank’s strategies and actions comprise an integrated liquidity risk management program that is designed to ensure low exposure to liquidity risk and compliance with regulatory requirements. The Bank’s ALCO oversees the Bank’s liquidity risk management program. It ensur es there are effective management structures and practices in place to properly measure and manage liquidity risk. The GLF Committee, a subcommittee of the ALCO comprised of senior management from Treasury, Risk Management and Wholesale Banking, identifies and monitors the Bank’s liquidity risks. The management of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the SET member responsible for Treasury, while oversight and challenge is provided by the ALCO and independently by Risk Management. The Risk Committee regularly reviews the Bank’s liquidity position and approves the Bank’s Liquidity Risk Management Framework bi-annually and the related policies annually. The Bank has established TDGUS as TD’s U.S. IHC, as well as a CUSO r eporting unit that consists of the IHC and TD’s U.S. branch and agency network. Both TDGUS and CUSO are managed to the U.S. Enhanced Prudential Standards liquidity requirements in addition to the Bank’s liquidity management framework. 100",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report outlines its approach to managing insurance and liquidity risks. Insurance risk involves potential financial losses due to discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes in insurance operations, including underwriting, claims, and reinsurance. The bank's insurance risk management is overseen by senior management and the Chief Risk Officer for Insurance, with additional oversight from various committees and boards.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS The following areas are responsible for measuring, monitoring, and managing liquidity risks for major business segments: • Enterprise Liquidity Risk in Risk Management is responsible for maintaining liquidity risk management and asset pledging policies, along with associated limits, standards, and processes which are established to ensure that consistent and efficient liquidity management approaches are applied across all of the Bank’s operations. Risk Management jointly owns the Liquidity Risk Management Framework along with the SET member responsible for Treasury. Enterprise Liquidity Risk provides oversight of liquidity risk across the enterprise and provides independent risk assessment and effective challenge of liquidity risk management. Capital Markets Risk Management is responsible for independent liquidity risk metric reporting; • Treasury Liquidity Management manages the liquidity position of the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, Wealth Management and Insurance, Corporate, Wholesale Banking, and U.S. Retail segments, as well as the liquidity position of CUSO; and • Other regional operations, including those within TD’s insurance business, foreign branches, and/or subsidiaries are responsible for managing their liquidity risk in compliance with their own policies, and local regulatory requirements, while maintaining alignment with the enterprise framework. The Bank manages the liquidity profile of its businesses to be within the defined liquidity risk appetite, and maintains target r equirements for liquidity survivability using a combination of internal and regulatory measures. The Bank’s overall liquidity requirement is defined as the amount of liquid assets the Bank needs to hold to be able to cover expected future cash flow requirements, plus a prudent reserve against potential cash outflows in the event of a capital markets disruption or other events that could affect the Bank’s access to funding or destabilize its deposit base. The Bank maintains an internal view for measuring and managing liquidity that uses an assumed Sever e Combined Stress Scenario (SCSS). The SCSS considers potential liquidity requirements during a crisis resulting from a loss of confidence in the Bank’s ability to meet obligations as they come due. In addition to this bank-specific event, the SCSS also incorporates the impact of a stressed market-wide liquidity event that results in a significant reduction in the availability of funding for all institutions and a decrease in the marketability of assets. The Bank’s liquidity risk management policies stipulate that the Bank must maintain a suf ficient level of liquid assets to support business growth, and to cover identified stressed liquidity requirements under the SCSS, for a period of up to 90 days. The Bank calculates stressed liquidity requirements for the SCSS related to the following conditions: • wholesale funding maturing in the next 90 days (assumes maturing debt will be repaid instead of rolled over); • accelerated attrition or “run-off” of deposit balances; • increased utilization of available credit and liquidity facilities; and • increased collateral requirements associated with downgrades in the Bank’s credit ratings and adverse movement in reference rates for derivative and securities financing transactions. The Bank also manages its liquidity to comply with the regulatory liquidity r equirements in the OSFI LAR (the LCR, the NSFR, and the Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) monitoring tool). The LCR requires that banks maintain a minimum liquidity coverage of 100% over a 30-day stress period, the NSFR requires that banks maintain available stable funding (ASF) in excess of required stable funding (RSF) for periods up to one year (a minimum NSFR of 100%), and the NCCF monitors the Bank’s detailed cash flow gaps for various time bands. As a result, the Bank’s liquidity is managed to the higher of its internal liquidity requirements and target buffers over the regulatory minimums. The Bank considers potential regulatory restrictions on liquidity transferability in the calculation of enterprise liquidity positions. Accor dingly, surplus liquidity domiciled in regulated subsidiaries may be excluded from consolidated liquidity positions as appropriate. The Bank’s Funds Transfer Pricing process considers liquidity risk as a key determinant of the cost or cr edit of funds to the retail and wholesale banking businesses. Liquidity costs are reflective of the funding needs and reserve requirements driven by the liquidity risk profile of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. Liquidity costs are also applied to other contingent obligations like undrawn lines of credit provided to customers. The unencumbered liquid assets the Bank holds to meet its liquidity r equirements must be high-quality securities that the Bank believes can be monetized quickly in stress conditions with minimum loss in market value. The liquidity value of unencumbered liquid assets considers estimated market or trading depths, settlement timing, and/or other identified impediments to potential sale or pledging. 101",

The Enterprise Liquidity Risk in Risk Management is responsible for maintaining policies and frameworks to ensure consistent liquidity management. Treasury Liquidity Management oversees the liquidity positions of various segments, while regional operations manage their liquidity risks in line with local regulations and the enterprise framework. The bank uses a Severe Combined Stress Scenario (SCSS) to assess potential liquidity needs during crises, ensuring it holds sufficient liquid assets to cover expected cash flow requirements and potential outflows. The bank adheres to regulatory requirements, such as the OSFI LAR, LCR, NSFR, and NCCF, and manages liquidity to exceed both internal and regulatory minimums. Liquidity costs are integrated into the bank's Funds Transfer Pricing process, reflecting the risk profile of its assets and liabilities. The bank's unencumbered liquid assets are high-quality securities that can be quickly monetized in stress conditions."

Where a particular asset has been encumbered and TD has holdings of the asset both on- balance sheet and off-balance sheet, for the purpose of this disclosure, the on- and off-balance sheet holdings are encumbered in alignment with the business practice. 2 Assets received as collateral through off-balance sheet transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, margin loans, and other client activity. 3 Represents assets that have been posted externally to support the Bank’s day-to- day operations, including securities financing transactions, clearing and payments, and derivative transactions. Also includes assets that have been pledged supporting Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) activity. 4 Assets supporting TD’s long-term funding activities, assets pledged against securitization liabilities, and assets held by consolidated securitization vehicles or in pools for covered bond issuance. 5 Assets that are considered readily available in their current legal form to generate funding or support collateral needs. This category includes reported FHLB assets that remain unutilized and DSAC that are available for collateral purposes however not regularly utilized in practice. 6 Assets that cannot be used to support funding or collateral requirements in their current form. This category includes those assets that are potentially eligible as funding program collateral or for pledging to central banks (for example, CMHC insured mortgages that can be securitized into NHA MBS). 7 Includes trading loans, securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL and other financial assets designated at FVTPL, financial assets at FVOCI, and DSAC. 8 Assets reported in the “Bank-owned assets” column represent the value of the loans extended and not the value of the collateral received. The loan value from the reverse repurchase transactions is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double-counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 9 The loan value from the margin loans/client activity is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double-counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 10 Other assets include investment in Schwab, goodwill, other intangibles, land, buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets, deferred tax assets, amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, and other assets on the balance sheet not reported in the above categories. In addition to the SCSS, the Bank performs liquidity stress testing on multiple alternate scenarios. These scenarios ar e a mix of TD-specific events and market-wide stress events designed to test the impact from risk factors material to the Bank’s risk profile. Liquidity assessments are also part of the Bank’s EWST program. The Bank has liquidity contingency funding plans (CFP) in place at the overall Bank level and for certain subsidiaries operating in for eign jurisdictions (Regional CFPs). The Bank’s CFP provides a documented framework for managing unexpected liquidity situations and thus is an integral component of the Bank’s overall liquidity risk management program. It outlines different contingency levels based on the severity and duration of the liquidity situation and identifies recovery actions appropriate for each level. For each recovery action, it provides key operational steps required to execute the action. Regional CFPs identify recovery actions to address region-specific stress events. The actions and governance structure outlined in the Bank’s CFP are aligned with the Bank’s Crisis Management Recovery Plan. Credit ratings impact the Bank’s borrowing costs and ability to raise funds. Rating downgrades could potentially r esult in higher financing costs, increased requirements to pledge collateral, reduced access to capital markets, and could also affect the Bank’s ability to enter into derivative transactions. Credit ratings and outlooks provided by rating agencies reflect their views and ar e subject to change from time to time, based on a number of factors including the Bank’s financial strength, competitive position, and liquidity, as well as factors not entirely within the Bank’s control, including the methodologies used by rating agencies and conditions affecting the overall financial services industry. 104 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report provides a detailed analysis of its liquidity management and asset holdings. As of October 31, 2023, the bank's total liquid assets amounted to CAD 868 billion, with a significant portion (68%) denominated in non-Canadian currencies. The report highlights a decrease in unencumbered liquid assets by CAD 52 billion from the previous year, primarily due to lower deposit balances in the U.S. Retail segment. The bank's liquidity strategy includes maintaining a mix of encumbered and unencumbered assets to support funding needs and mitigate liquidity risks. The report also outlines the bank's contingency funding plans and stress testing scenarios to manage unexpected liquidity situations. Additionally, the bank emphasizes the impact of credit ratings on its borrowing costs and access to capital markets, noting that downgrades could lead to higher financing costs and reduced market access."

The Bank regularly reviews the level of increased collateral its trading counterparties would require in the event of a downgrade of TD’s credit rating. The Bank holds liquid assets to ensure it is able to provide additional collateral required by trading counterparties in the event of a three-notch downgrade in the Bank’s senior debt ratings. The following table presents the additional collateral that could have been contractually required to be posted to over-the-counter (OTC) derivative counterparties as of the reporting date in the event of one, two, and three-notch downgrades of the Bank’s credit ratings. | TABLE 52 ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR RATING DOWNGRADES 1 (millions of Canadian dollars) Average for the years ended October 31 2023 October 31 2022 One-notch downgrade $ 124 $ 182 Two-notch downgrade 192 290 Three-notch downgrade 913 1,129 1 The above collateral requirements are based on each OTC trading counterparty’s Credit Support Annex and the Bank’s credit rating across applicable rating agencies. The LCR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of the stock of unencumbered HQLA over the net cash outflow requirements in the next 30 days under a hypothetical liquidity stress event. Other than during periods of financial stress, the Bank must maintain the LCR above 100% in accordance with the OSFI LAR requirement. The Bank’s LCR is calculated according to the scenario parameters in the LAR guideline, including prescribed HQLA eligibility criteria and haircuts, deposit run-off rates, and other outflow and inflow rates. HQLA held by the Bank that are eligible for the LCR calculation under the LAR are primarily central bank reserves, sovereign-issued or sovereign-guaranteed securities, and high-quality securities issued by non-financial entities.

        "summary": "The text provides a detailed overview of The Toronto-Dominion Bank's credit ratings as of October 31, 2023, from major rating agencies including Moody’s, S&P, Fitch, and DBRS. The ratings cover various financial instruments such as deposits, senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred shares, and short-term debt, all of which have a stable outlook. The text also discusses the potential additional collateral requirements in the event of a downgrade in the bank's credit ratings, with specific figures for one, two, and three-notch downgrades. Additionally, it mentions the bank's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a Basel III metric, which must be maintained above 100% as per regulatory requirements. The LCR is calculated based on high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) and net cash outflows under stress scenarios."

These activities include clearing, custody, or cash management services. 7 Includes uncommitted credit and liquidity facilities, stable value money market mutual funds, outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, and other contractual cash outflows. With respect to outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, TD has no contractual obligation to buy back these outstanding TD debt securities, and as a result, a 0% outflow rate is applied under the OSFI LAR guideline. 8 Total HQLA includes both asset haircuts and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (HQLA assets after haircuts are capped at 40% for Level 2 and 15% for Level 2B). 9 Total Net Cash Outflows include both inflow and outflow rates and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (inflows are capped at 75% of outflows). The Bank’s average LCR of 130% for the quarter ended October 31, 2023 continues to meet the regulatory requirements. The Bank holds a variety of liquid assets commensurate with the liquidity needs of the organization. Many of these assets qualify as HQLA under the OSFI LAR guideline. The average HQLA of the Bank for the quarter ended October 31, 2023 was $325 billion (July 31, 2023 – $324 billion), with Level 1 assets r epresenting 82% (July 31, 2023 – 83%). The Bank’s reported HQLA excludes excess HQLA from the U.S. Retail operations, as required by the OSFI LAR guideline, to reflect liquidity transfer considerations between U.S. Retail and its affiliates as a result of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s regulations. By excluding excess HQLA, the U.S. Retail LCR is effectively capped at 100% prior to total Bank consolidation. The NSFR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of total ASF over total RSF in accor dance with OSFI’s LAR guideline. The Bank must maintain an NSFR ratio equal to or above 100% in accordance with the LAR guideline. The Bank’s ASF comprises the Bank’s liability and capital instruments (including deposits and wholesale funding).

These may include, but are not limited to, items such as capital with perpetual maturity, non- maturity deposits, short positions, open maturity positions, non-HQLA equities, and physical traded commodities. 2 Weighted values are calculated after the application of respective NSFR weights, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline. 3 As defined by the OSFI LAR guideline, stable deposits from retail and SME customers are deposits that are insured and are either held in transactional accounts or the depositors have an established relationship with the Bank that makes deposit withdrawals highly unlikely. 4 Operational deposits from non-SME business customers are deposits kept with the Bank in order to facilitate their access and ability to conduct payment and settlement activities. These activities include clearing, custody, or cash management services. 5 Interdependent asset and liability items are deemed by OSFI to be interdependent and have RSF and ASF risk factors adjusted to zero. Interdependent liabilities cannot fall due while the asset is still on balance sheet, cannot be used to fund any other assets and principal payments from the asset cannot be used for anything other than repaying the liability. As such, the only interdependent assets and liabilities that qualify for this treatment at the Bank are the liabilities arising from the Canada Mortgage Bonds Program and their corresponding encumbered assets. 6 Includes Residential Mortgages and HELOCs. The Bank’s NSFR as at October 31, 2023 is 117% (October 31, 2022 – 122%), representing a surplus of $163 billion, adhering to regulatory requirements. Decreases are attributable to changes in our funding composition and lower deposit balance in the U.S. Bank. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 107",
        "summary": "The text provides a detailed analysis of TD Bank's liquidity and funding metrics as of October 31, 2023, focusing on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The bank's average LCR for the quarter was 130%, indicating it holds sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover net cash outflows, meeting regulatory requirements. The average HQLA was $325 billion, with Level 1 assets comprising 82%. The NSFR was 117%, down from 122% the previous year, due to changes in funding composition and lower deposit balances in the U.S. operations. The bank maintains a surplus of $163 billion in stable funding, adhering to regulatory guidelines."

The Bank’s funding activities are conducted in accordance with liquidity risk management policies that require assets be funded to the appropriate term and to a prudent diversification profile. The Bank’s primary approach to managing funding activities is to maximize the use of deposits raised through personal and commercial banking channels. The following table illustrates the Bank’s base of personal and commercial, wealth, and Schwab sweep deposits (collectively, “P&C deposits”) that make up approximately 70% (2022 – 70%) of the Bank’s total funding. The Bank maintains various registered external wholesale term (greater than 1 year) funding programs to provide access to diversified funding sources, including asset securitization, covered bonds, and unsecured wholesale debt. The Bank raises term funding through Senior Notes, NHA MBS, and notes backed by credit card receivables (Evergreen Credit Card Trust) and HELOC (Genesis Trust II). The Bank’s wholesale funding is diversified by geography, by currency, and by funding types. The Bank raises short-term (1 year and less) funding using certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and BA.

MATURITY ANALYSIS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet categories by remaining contractual maturity . Off-balance sheet commitments include contractual obligations to make future payments on certain lease-related commitments, certain purchase obligations, and other liabilities. The values of credit instruments reported in the following table represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the Bank could be obligated to extend should such instruments be fully drawn or utilized. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contractual amounts is not representative of expected future liquidity requirements. These contractual obligations have an impact on the Bank’s short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The maturity analysis presented does not depict the degree of the Bank’s maturity transformation or the Bank’ s exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk. The Bank’s objective is to fund its assets appropriately to protect against borrowing cost volatility and potential reductions to funding market availability. The Bank utilizes stable non-maturity deposits (chequing and savings accounts) and term deposits as the primary source of long-term funding for the Bank’s non-trading assets including personal and business term loans and the stable balance of revolving lines of credit. Additionally, the Bank issues long-term funding in respect of such non- trading assets and raises short-term funding primarily to finance trading assets. The liquidity of trading assets under stressed market conditions is considered when determining the appropriate term of the funding.

        "chunk": "Capital Adequacy Risk Capital adequacy risk is the risk of insufficient level and composition of capital being available in relation to the amount of capital required to carry out the Bank’s strategy and/or satisfy regulatory and internal capital adequacy requirements under normal and stress conditions. Capital is held to protect the viability of the Bank in the event of unexpected financial losses. Capital r epresents the loss-absorbing funding required to provide a cushion to protect depositors and other creditors from unexpected losses. Managing capital levels requires that the Bank holds sufficient capital, in normal and str ess environments, to avoid the risk of breaching minimum capital levels prescribed by regulators and internal Board limits. The Board oversees the Bank’s capital adequacy and capital management by r eviewing adherence to capital targets and approving the annual capital plan and the Capital Adequacy Risk Management Policy. The Risk Committee reviews and approves the Capital Adequacy Risk Management Framework. The CRO and the CFO oversee that the Bank’s ICAAP is effective in meeting capital adequacy requirements. The ALCO recommends and maintains the Capital Adequacy Risk Management Framework and the Capital Adequacy Risk Management Policy , and sets additional capital targets and minimum requirements, including the allocation of capital limits to business segments, to support ongoing compliance with the Capital Adequacy Risk Management Policy. The ALCO also reviews the ongoing adherence to established capital targets in support of the effective and prudent management of the Bank’s capital position and maintenance of adequate capital. TBSM is responsible for forecasting and monitoring compliance with capital targets, on a consolidated basis, with oversight pr ovided by ALCO. TBSM updates the capital forecast, including appropriate changes to capital issuance, repurchase and redemption. The capital forecast is reviewed by ALCO. TBSM also leads the ICAAP and EWST processes. The Bank’s business segments are responsible for managing to the allocated capital limits. Additionally, regulated subsidiaries of the Bank, including certain insurance subsidiaries and subsidiaries in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, manage their capital adequacy risk in accor dance with applicable regulatory requirements. Capital management policies and procedures of subsidiaries are also required to conform with those of the Bank. U.S. regulated subsidiaries of the Bank are required to follow several regulatory guidelines, rules and expectations related to capital planning and stress testing including the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation YY establishing Enhanced Prudential Standards for Foreign Banking Organizations, applicable to U.S. Bank Holding Companies. Refer to the sections on “Future Regulatory Capital Developments”, “Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing”, and “Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results” for further details. Capital resources are managed in a manner designed so that the Bank’s capital position can support business strategies under both curr ent and future business operating environments. The Bank manages its operations within the capital constraints defined by both internal and regulatory capital requirements, so that it meets the higher of these requirements. Regulatory capital requirements represent minimum capital levels. Capital targets ar e established to provide a sufficient buffer so that the Bank is able to continuously meet these minimum capital requirements. The purpose of these capital targets is to reduce the risk of a breach of minimum capital requirements, due to unexpected events, allowing management the opportunity to react to declining capital levels before minimum capital requirements are breached. A periodic monitoring process is undertaken to plan and forecast capital r equirements. As part of the annual planning process, business segments are allocated individual RWA and Leverage exposure limits. Capital generation and usage are monitored and reported to the ALCO. The Bank assesses the sensitivity of its forecast capital requirements and new capital formations to various economic conditions thr ough its EWST process. The results of the EWST are considered in the determination of capital targets and capital risk appetite limits. The Bank also determines its internal capital requirements through the ICAAP pr ocess using models to measure the risk-based capital required based on its own tolerance for the risk of unexpected losses. This risk tolerance is calibrated to the required confidence level so that the Bank will be able to meet its obligations, even after absorbing severe unexpected losses over a one-year period. In addition, the Bank has a Capital Contingency Plan that is designed to pr epare management to maintain capital adequacy through periods of bank-specific or systemic market stress. The Capital Contingency Plan outlines the governance and procedures to be followed if the Bank’s consolidated capital levels are forecast to fall below capital targets or when there are capital concerns from disruptive events or trends. It also outlines potential management actions that may be taken to prevent such a breach from occurring. Legal, Regulatory Compliance and Conduct Risk Legal, Regulatory Compliance and Conduct (LRCC) risk is the risk associated with the Bank’s failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, contractual obligations, the Bank’s Code of Conduct and Ethics, or standards of fair business conduct or market conduct, which can lead to fines, sanctions, liabilities, or reputational harm that could be material to the Bank. The Bank is exposed to LRCC risk in virtually all of its activities. Failure to mitigate LRCC risk and meet r egulatory and legal requirements can impact the Bank’s ability to meet strategic objectives, poses a risk of censure or penalty, may lead to litigation, and puts the Bank’s reputation at risk. Financial penalties, reputational damage, and other costs associated with legal proceedings and unfavourable judicial or regulatory determinations may also adversely affect the Bank’s business, results of operations and financial condition. LRCC risk generally cannot be effectively mitigated by trying to limit its impact to any one business or jurisdiction as realized LRCC risk may adversely impact unrelated businesses or jurisdictions. LRCC risk exposure is inherent in the normal course of operating the Bank’s businesses. Known LRCC risks continue to rapidly evolve as a result of evolving regulatory expectations, as well as new or emerging threats, including geopolitical and those associated with use of new, emerging and interrelated technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, models and decision-making tools. WHO MANAGES LEGAL, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, The proactive and effective management of LRCC risk is complex given the br eadth and pervasiveness of exposure. The LRCC Risk Management Framework applies enterprise-wide to the Bank and to all its corporate functions, business segments, its governance, risk, and oversight functions, and its subsidiaries, and is aligned with the Bank’s ERF. All the Bank’s businesses are accountable for operating their business in compliance with LRCC requirements applicable to their jurisdiction and specific businesses. Businesses are also accountable for the LRCC risk that they generate in their operations, including LRCC risks that may arise in their dealings with third-party vendors. These accountabilities involve assessing the risk, designing and implementing controls, and monitoring and reporting on their ongoing effectiveness to safeguard the businesses from operating outside of the Bank’s risk appetite. Independent oversight functions (the “Oversight Functions”) such as Compliance, GAML, Enterprise Conduct Risk Management, and Regulatory Risk are designated and accountable for RCM oversight and provide objective guidance, and oversight with respect to managing LRCC risk. Legal and Regulatory Risk provide advice with respect to managing LRCC risk. Representatives of these groups interact regularly with senior executives of the Bank’s businesses. Also, the senior management of Legal, Compliance, and GAML have established regular meetings with and reporting to the Audit Committee, which oversees the establishment and maintenance of policies and programs designed to help achieve and maintain the Bank’s compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. Senior management of the Compliance Department and Enterprise Conduct Risk Management also report regularly to the Corporate Governance Committee, which oversees conduct risk management in the Bank, the establishment and maintenance of policies in respect of the Bank’s compliance with the consumer protection provisions of the Canadian Financial Consumer Protection Framework, 112 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS",
        "summary": "The text discusses two main types of risks faced by a bank: Capital Adequacy Risk and Legal, Regulatory Compliance, and Conduct (LRCC) Risk.\n\n1. **Capital Adequacy Risk**: This risk involves the bank's ability to maintain sufficient capital levels to support its strategy and meet regulatory and internal requirements under normal and stress conditions. Capital is crucial for absorbing unexpected financial losses and protecting depositors and creditors. The bank manages this risk through a comprehensive framework involving the Board, Risk Committee, CRO, CFO, ALCO, and TBSM, which oversee capital adequacy, set targets, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards. The bank also uses processes like ICAAP and EWST to forecast and manage capital needs, and has a Capital Contingency Plan for stress scenarios.\n\n2. **Legal, Regulatory Compliance, and Conduct Risk**: This risk arises from failing to comply with laws, regulations, and ethical standards, potentially leading to fines, sanctions, or reputational harm. The bank faces LRCC risk across all its activities, and it is managed through an enterprise-wide framework. Each business segment is responsible for compliance within its jurisdiction, while independent oversight functions provide guidance and monitoring. Senior management regularly reports to committees overseeing compliance and conduct risk management, ensuring alignment with regulatory expectations and internal policies.\n\nOverall, the bank employs structured frameworks and oversight to manage these risks, ensuring operational resilience and regulatory compliance."

In addition, senior management of Regulatory Risk has established periodic reporting to the Board and regular reporting to the Risk Committee. HOW TD MANAGES LEGAL, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE Effective management of LRCC risk is a result of enterprise-wide collaboration and r equires (a) independent and objective identification and assessment of LRCC risk, (b) objective guidance and advisory services and/or independent challenge and oversight to identify, assess, control, and monitor LRCC risk, and (c) an approved set of frameworks, policies, procedures, guidelines, and practices. While each business line is accountable for effectively managing LRCC risk, each of the Oversight Functions plays a critical role in the management of LRCC risk at the Bank. Depending on the circumstances, they play different roles at different times: ‘trusted advisor’, provider of objective guidance, independent challenge, and oversight and control (including ‘gatekeeper’ or approver). In particular, Compliance performs the following functions: it acts as an independent Regulatory Compliance oversight function to establish enterprise standar ds for business and Oversight Functions in managing LRCC risk; it fosters a culture of integrity, ethics and compliance across the organization to manage and mitigate Regulatory Compliance Risks; it assesses the adequacy of, adherence to, and effectiveness of the Bank’s day-to-day RCM controls; it proactively manages regulatory change and maintains a Regulatory Change Standard for Oversight Functions to do the same; and it supports the Chief Compliance Officer in providing an opinion to the Audit Committee as to whether the RCM controls are sufficiently robust to achieve compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Enterprise Conduct Risk Management is an oversight function that works with key enterprise and segment stakeholders to mitigate conduct risk acr oss the organization. It works in partnership with Compliance, Human Resources and Operational Risk Management to provide oversight and challenge to the businesses in their management of conduct risk. GAML acts as an independent regulatory compliance and risk management oversight function and is r esponsible for regulatory compliance and the broader prudential risk management components of the AML, Anti-Terrorist Financing, Sanctions, and Anti-Bribery/Anti- Corruption programs (collectively, the “GAML Programs”), including their design, content, and enterprise-wide implementation; develops standards, monitors, evaluates, and reports on GAML program controls, design, and execution; and reports on the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the GAML Programs, including program design and operation. In addition, Compliance and GAML have developed methodologies and processes to measure and aggregate regulatory compliance risks, AML program and conduct risks on an ongoing basis as a baseline to assess whether the Bank’s internal controls are effective in adequately mitigating such risks and determine whether individual or aggregate business activities are conducted within the Bank’s risk appetite. Legal acts as an independent provider of legal services and advice and pr otects the Bank from unacceptable legal risk. Legal has also developed methodologies for measuring litigation risk for adherence to the Bank’s risk appetite. Processes employed by Legal, Compliance, and GAML (including policies and frameworks, training and education, and the Bank’ s Code of Conduct and Ethics) support the responsibility of each business to adhere to LRCC requirements. Finally, the Bank’s Regulatory Risk and Government Affairs departments also cr eate and facilitate communication with elected officials and regulators, monitor legislation and regulations, support business relationships with governments, coordinate regulatory examinations and regulatory findings remediation, support regulatory discussions on new or proposed products or business initiatives, and advance the public policy objectives of the Bank. Reputational Risk Reputational risk is the potential that stakeholder perceptions, whether true or not, regarding the Bank’s business practices, actions or inactions, will or may cause a significant decline in the Bank’s value, brand, liquidity or customer base, or require costly measures to address. A company’s reputation is a valuable business asset that is essential to optimizing shar eholder value and therefore, is constantly at risk. Reputational risk can arise as a consequence of negative perceptions about the Bank’s business practices involving any aspect of the Bank’s operations and usually involves concerns about business ethics and integrity, competence, or the quality or suitability of products and services. Since all risk categories can have an impact on a company’s reputation, reputational risk is not managed in isolation from the Bank’s other major risk categories and can ultimately impact its brand, earnings, and capital. Responsibility for managing risks to the Bank’s reputation ultimately lies with the SET and the executive committees that examine r eputational risk as part of their regular mandate. The ERRC is the most senior executive committee for the review of reputational risk matters at TD. The mandate of the ERRC is to oversee the management of reputational risk within the Bank’s risk appetite. Its main accountability is to review and assess business and corporate initiatives and activities where significant reputational risk profiles have been identified and escalated. The ERRC also provides a forum for discussion, review, and escalation for non-traditional risks. At the same time, every employee and representative of the Bank has a r esponsibility to contribute in a positive way to the Bank’s reputation and the management of reputational risk. This means that every Bank employee is responsible for following ethical practices at all times, complying with applicable policies, legislation, and regulations and are also supporting positive interactions with the Bank’s stakeholders. Reputational risk is most effectively managed when everyone at the Bank works continuously to protect and enhance the Bank’s reputation. The Bank’s approach to the management of reputational risk combines the experience and knowledge of individual business segments, corporate shar ed service areas and governance, risk and oversight functions. It is based on enabling the Bank’s businesses to understand their risks and developing the policies, processes, and controls required to manage these risks appropriately and in line with the Bank’s strategy and reputational risk appetite. The Bank’s Reputational Risk Management Framework provides a comprehensive overview of its approach to the management of this risk. Amongst other significant policies, the Bank’s Enterprise Reputational Risk Management Policy is approved by the Group Head and CRO and sets out the requirements under which business segments and corporate shared services are required to manage reputational risk. These requirements include implementing procedures and designating a business-level committee (where required by the Policy) to review and assess reputational risks and escalation to the ERRC as appropriate. The Bank also has an enterprise-wide New Business and Product Approval (NBP A) Policy that is approved by the CRO and establishes standard practices to support consistent processes for approving new businesses, products, and services across the Bank. The policy is supported by business segment specific processes, which involve independent review from oversight functions, and consideration of all aspects of a new product, including reputational risk.

        "chunk": "Environmental and Social Risk E&S risk is the risk of financial loss, reputational damage or other harm resulting from the Bank’s inability to manage and respond to changing environmental or social factors, including climate change, that impact or are associated with the Bank’s operations, business activities, products, clients, or the communities the Bank operates in. Management of E&S risk is an enterprise-wide priority. Drivers of E&S risk ar e often multi-faceted and can originate from the Bank’s internal environment, including its operations, business activities, E&S-related targets, commitments and disclosure, products, clients, colleagues, or suppliers. Drivers of E&S risk can also originate from the Bank’s external environment, including the communities in which the Bank operates as well as second-order impacts of physical risks and the transition to a low-carbon economy. E&S risk and the Bank’s sustainability strategy are managed within a gover nance structure that balances broad engagement across the organization with line-of-sight accountability. The Board and senior executives oversee E&S risk and assess and manage potential impacts on the Bank’s business strategies and financial performance. The Board continues to oversee E&S risk as a top and emerging risk for the Bank and receives regular updates on the Bank’s progress on E&S matters. The Bank’s various business-specific and enterprise risk committees provide oversight of, and support management accountability for , existing and emerging E&S risks relevant to the Bank. The ESG Senior Executive Team Forum, comprised of senior executives from TD’ s business and corporate segments, provides oversight of ESG and related strategy development. The Senior Vice President, Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship holds senior executive accountability for the Bank’ s sustainability strategy and engages leaders across the Bank to execute on the strategy. In particular, the Enterprise Sustainable Finance and Enterprise Decarbonization teams were established to support business opportunities, and execute on achieving the Bank’s net zero target. The Senior Vice President, ESG Risk Management, holds senior executive accountability for E&S risk management and leads the Envir onmental & Social Risk Management (ESRM) team, the ESG Credit Risk team, and the ESG Central Office. The ESRM team establishes E&S risk frameworks, policies, processes, governance and reporting structures to help segments identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report on E&S risks, including climate risk. The ESG Credit Risk team develops and manages E&S risk tools and programs for the Bank’s retail and non-retail lending activities, at both the borrower and the portfolio levels. The ESG Central Office leads the development and continued evolution of the Bank’s ESG/Climate Target Operating Model (TOM) and related implementation plan. The ESG Financial Reporting team within the Chief Accountant’s Department was established to gr ow internal capabilities to facilitate the integration of sustainability-related financial reporting requirements into the Bank’s financial disclosures. Internal polices and procedures require business and corporate segments to consider the applicability and assessment of E&S risk in curr ent and new business activity. Internal policies also require business unit governance and business processes to incorporate an assessment of E&S risk and apply an appropriate level of governance and oversight consistent with their business procedures. The Bank follows a disciplined approach to manage significant and/or material E&S risks which may have a pr esent or future impact on the Bank’s competitive position, brand, or long-term shareholder value creation. The Bank is focused on considering current and potential future E&S risks – including climate change and social risks – in the strategies it executes, as appropriate, by enabling informed decision-making based on internal capabilities, industry practices, legal and regulatory obligations, and shareholder expectations, as they continue to evolve. The Bank manages E&S risk through the Enterprise E&S Risk Framework which sets the framework for how TD manages E&S risk. This Framework is r einforced by risk-specific policies including the Enterprise E&S Risk Policy which outlines the requirements and expectations for the effective management of E&S risk at the Bank. The Bank has policies and procedures which outline how E&S risk is identified and managed within the Bank’ s non-retail lending portfolio. The Bank has also been a signatory of the Equator Principles (EP) since 2007 and has embedded the EP into its E&S risk process for applicable project financing transactions. The EP are a voluntary set of minimum due diligence standards to help financial institutions determine, assess, manage, and report on E&S risks with respect to in-scope project financing. EP signatories choose to voluntarily adopt and apply the EP as part of their due diligence processes to help support responsible risk decision-making. The Bank continues to assess the impacts associated with material changes made to TD pr oducts, services, projects, and initiatives by incorporating an E&S risk assessment into the Bank’s Change Risk Management process. Additionally, the Bank’s enterprise-wide Business Continuity and Crisis Management Program continues to support management’s ability to operate the Bank’s businesses and operations in the event of a business disruption incident, including the incremental impact of climate change. The Bank’s E&S metrics, targets and performance are publicly reported within its annual Sustainability Report and its annual Climate Action Plan (CAP): Report on Pr ogress and Update on the Task Force on Climate- Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Key performance measures are reported in alignment with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the FSB’s TCFD recommendations, with select metrics that are independently assured. Climate Risk Climate risk is the risk of reputational damage and/or financial loss arising fr om materialized credit, market, operational or other risks resulting from the physical and transition risks of climate change to the Bank, its clients or the communities the Bank operates in. This includes physical risks arising from the consequences of a changing climate, as well as transition risks arising from the process of shifting to a low-carbon economy. In its 2022 CAP Report, the Bank highlighted the progress on its CAP , as well as its efforts to assess and report climate-related risks and opportunities. The Bank continues to work towards building its expertise and capabilities for managing climate-related risks and opportunities. The Bank continues to evolve its ESG/Climate TOM to support its work to implement TD’ s CAP and to manage climate risks through dedicated work streams, including an enterprise climate risk strategy and scenario analysis program. The ESG/Climate TOM outlines the Bank’s strategy establishing Scope 3 financed emissions baselines and related reduction targets, advancing climate risk identification and measurement processes, and developing the Bank’s enterprise climate data strategy. The Bank is developing methodologies and approaches, including building r elated tools and capabilities for climate risk measurement. One such tool is Climate Scenario Analysis, a key risk measurement tool that will help the Bank better understand the impacts of climate-related risks. Climate scenario analysis is a process for identifying and assessing the potential implications of a range of plausible future states under conditions of uncertainty. While scenarios are not designed to deliver precise outcomes or forecasts, they provide a way for the Bank to consider potential risk implications under various climate change pathways. The Bank’s continued participation in scenario analysis pilots supports the development of tools and capabilities regarding climate data and climate-related risk modelling. Developing these capabilities supports the Bank’s understanding of the transition and physical risks of climate change, which will help inform the Bank’s approach to further integrate climate-related risk management activities across the enterprise. 114 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS",
        "summary": "The text outlines TD Bank's approach to managing Environmental and Social (E&S) risks, emphasizing the importance of these risks as a priority across the organization. E&S risks, including climate change, can originate from both internal and external factors affecting the bank's operations, clients, and communities. The bank has established a governance structure to oversee E&S risk management, involving the Board, senior executives, and various committees. Key roles include the Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Corporate Citizenship and the Senior Vice President of ESG Risk Management, who lead efforts in sustainability strategy and E&S risk management, respectively.\n\nThe bank employs an Enterprise E&S Risk Framework and specific policies to manage these risks, incorporating the Equator Principles for project financing. It also integrates E&S risk assessments into its Change Risk Management process and maintains a Business Continuity and Crisis Management Program to address potential disruptions, including those from climate change.\n\nTD Bank reports its E&S metrics and performance in its annual Sustainability Report and Climate Action Plan, aligning with global standards like the GRI, SASB, and TCFD. The bank is actively developing tools and methodologies, such as Climate Scenario Analysis, to better understand and manage climate-related risks, focusing on both physical and transition risks associated with climate change."

        "chunk": "The Bank continues to r efresh and enhance the scope of its Climate Risk Heatmap, supported by an Industry Risk Review process, to support physical and transition climate risk identification and assessment and to r efine its understanding of the industry sector and geographic location sensitivities that climate risk may have on the Bank and its assets, clients, and communities in which it operates. The Heatmap was initially developed in 2021 by leveraging the Bank’s climate-related risk inventory and includes risk definitions to facilitate internal reporting of climate risk exposures and trends. The Bank contributes to public consultations on emerging climate issues, including disclosure frameworks pr oposed by regulators and standard setters. The Bank also engages with environmental and community NGOs, industry associations, rating agencies, Indigenous communities and responsible investment organizations. TD also participates in various North American working groups, and as a member of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, helps to develop and refine calculation methodologies for emerging climate metrics. In 2020, the Bank announced a target to achieve net-zer o greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the Bank’s operations and financing activities by 2050, in alignment with the associated principles of the Paris Agreement. In 2021, the Bank joined the United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative’s Net-Zero Banking Alliance (UNEP FI’s NZBA), a global, industry-led initiative to accelerate and support efforts to address climate change and help facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The Bank continues its membership in the Risk Management Association Climate Risk Consortium, which focuses on bringing financial institutions together to advance the awareness of and addr ess the risks relevant to climate change, by developing frameworks, and recommendations for governance, disclosure, and risk management principles. The Bank announced an interim target to achieve an absolute reduction in GHG emissions from the Bank’ s operations (Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions) by 25% by 2025, relative to a 2019 baseline. In 2022, the Bank disclosed emissions associated with the Bank’s financing portfolio for two carbon- intensive sectors (Energy and Power Generation) and set NZBA-aligned interim (2030) Scope 3 financed emissions targets for these sectors. In March 2023, the Bank expanded its Scope 3 financed emissions footprint and set interim (2030) targets for two additional sectors – Automotive Manufacturing and Aviation. In March 2023, the Bank set a new $500 billion Sustainable & Decarbonization Finance Target to support key envir onmental, decarbonization, and social activities by 2030. A prior target set in 2017 of $100 billion in low-carbon lending, financing, asset management and internal corporate programs by 2030 was achieved in 2022. This new target represents the next step in the Bank’s efforts to help support its customers and clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy and help contribute to improving social outcomes. The eligible environmental, decarbonization and social activities are focused on supporting progress toward key sustainability objectives of TD such as climate change mitigation and adaptation and economic inclusion. The Bank monitors and assesses legal, policy, regulatory, economic, technological and stakeholder developments regar ding E&S matters, including the transition to net zero, and how those developments may affect its E&S metrics and targets. Accordingly, the Bank may adjust its E&S metrics or targets to reflect these developments. In addition, E&S methodologies or standards used by regulators, the financial sector, industry groups or associations that the Bank participates in or belongs to, or that the Bank or its clients use to measure and report on their GHG emissions could result in TD amending or restating its baselines, calculated results or targets, and may result in the Bank withdrawing from or modifying its membership in certain groups or associations. Limitations on the availability and reliability of data may also impact the Bank’s ability to assess and evaluate E&S risks. These limitations are expected to improve over time as the Bank continues to advance its data capabilities by working with internal and exter nal subject matter experts, leading to more robust and reliable E&S risk monitoring, analysis, and reporting. The Bank assesses, and will continue to assess, the potential impacts of climate change and related risks on its operations, lending portfolios, investments, and businesses. TD Asset Management (TDAM) Since 2008, TDAM has been a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI). Under the UN PRI, investors commit to incorporate six principles of responsible investing which include the incorporation of financially material ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making pr ocesses, and active ownership or stewardship practices, as well as promoting acceptance and effective implementation of the principles. TDAM has a dedicated ESG Research and Engagement team that supports TDAM’s Sustainable Investing approach, which includes incorporating material ESG issues into certain investment processes, as applicable, and its active ownership policies and practices (e.g. proxy voting and engagement). TDAM monitors regulatory developments and assesses the impact of emerging ESG regulatory rules and guidance to ensure its Sustainable Investing approach and ESG related policies and procedures continue to be aligned with regulatory requirements. TD Securities (TDS) In 2020, TDS created a dedicated ESG Solutions group, which focuses on delivering integrated ESG solutions, primarily including activities within sustainable finance such as arranging sustainability-linked loans, underwriting green, social, sustainability , and sustainability linked (GSSS) bonds and ESG advisory services through TDS’ investment banking offerings. With the acquisition of TD Cowen in 2023, TDS has added an equity research platform to support its client’s sustainability efforts. TD Insurance (TDI) Since 2014, TDI has been a signatory to the UNEP FI Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), which serve as the global framework for insurance companies to develop an understanding of the opportunities to address E&S risks, including climate risk. T o further the integration of ESG into its decision-making, TDI established the TDI Executive Sustainability Governance Committee, comprised of leaders from across TDI who work to embed the PSI and ESG considerations into its operational framework. In 2019, TDI established its Advisory Board on Climate Change, comprised of experts from Engineers Canada and six top Canadian universities with expertise in fields related to climate change, severe weather and its impact on people and the planet. The Advisory Board, together with TDI executives, is focusing its efforts on key activities: addressing flood risk, resilience, and homeowner education. Climate risk considerations are embedded within TDI’s General Insurance Catastrophe and Reinsurance Policy, and as part of its RAS, in 2022 TDI began considering the impact of climate-related risks in the design of products and in assessment of pricing, reserving and reinsurance protection purchase, and evaluates potential impacts and recommends mitigation with respect to climate-related insurance losses through a newly established TDI Climate Risk Appetite Task Force. That same year, TDI began work with OSFI and the Bank of Canada to conduct the first national flood systemic risk assessment relating to mortgages and insurance coverage. TDI is providing data to support the analysis, which is expected to lead to a greater understanding of climate risks facing Canadians, in support of mitigation efforts. Regulatory and Standard Setter Developments Concerning E&S Risk (Including Climate) On March 7, 2023, OSFI issued Guideline B-15: Climate Risk Management (Guideline B-15), which sets out OSFI’s expectations r elated to the management and disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities. Components of Guideline B-15 are initially effective for D-SIBs for fiscal year-end 2024, and annual disclosures are required to be made publicly available no later than 180 days after fiscal year-end. The Bank has completed its initial assessment of Guideline B-15 and is working towards implementing the requirements. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 115",

        "chunk": "On June 26, 2023, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the IFRS Foundation, issued its first two sustainability standards, IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosures of Sustainability-related Financial Information and IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures. IFRS S1 sets out the disclosure requirements for financially material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities to meet investor information needs, and IFRS S2 specifically sets the disclosure requirement for Climate-related risks and opportunities. ISSB recommends an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and this is subject to Canadian jurisdiction’s endorsement. Early application is permitted on or before the date of initial application of IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has officially endorsed IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 on July 23, 2023 and is now calling its member jurisdictions to consider ways they may adopt or apply the ISSB standards. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopting these standards. Codes of Conduct and Human Rights The Bank has several policies, including the Bank’s Code of Conduct and Ethics, that r eflect the Bank’s commitment to manage its business responsibly and in compliance with applicable laws. For additional information on the Code of Conduct and Ethics, refer to the “Legal, Regulatory Compliance and Conduct Risk” section above. The Bank first released a Statement on Human Rights in 2020, which reflects the corporate responsibility to respect human rights as set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP). The Bank and its applicable subsidiaries also publish reports pursuant to modern slavery legislation to which they are subject. The Bank’s current modern slavery reporting can be found here: https://www.td.com/ca/en/ about-td/for -investors/policies-and-references. In 2022, the Bank implemented changes to address the Canadian federal Financial Consumer Pr otection Framework. The framework aims to promote responsible conduct across Canadian banks and protect financial services customers, including components related to promoting transparency for customers to help them make informed decisions and provisions related to fair and equitable dealings. The Bank’s Supplier Code of Conduct also reflects its commitment to r espect human rights. The Bank requires all new suppliers and suppliers with contracts that were renewed or amended after November 2019 to attest that they operate in accordance with the expectations described in the Bank’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes the protection of human rights. In addition, the Bank’s North American Supplier Diversity Program seeks to promote a level playing field and encourage the inclusion of women, Indigenous Peoples, Black, minority and 2SLGBTQ+ communities, people with disabilities, veterans, refugee entrepreneurs and other diverse suppliers in its procurement process. To reflect this goal, in 2021, the Bank’s Chief Procurement Officer released a Statement on Supplier Diversity, recognizing diversity and inclusion as both a core value and a business imperative. Social Framework In 2023, the Bank established TD Pathways to Economic Inclusion, a new social framework which focuses the Bank’ s efforts on three areas where the Bank believes it has the knowledge and resources to make a meaningful impact: employment access, financial access, and housing access. The framework will sustain and build upon the Bank’s longstanding commitment to improve financial and economic inclusion, focus the Bank’s efforts to further embed social factors into the Bank’s businesses, build on an area that has long been a priority for the Bank – diversity and inclusion – and strengthen the Bank’s commitment to help open doors for all members of the communities it serves. Since 2005, diversity and inclusion (D&I) has been embedded in the Bank’s business strategy and framework. The Bank’s lines of business have documented strategies and plans that align with and support the enterprise D&I strategy. Teams dedicated to Indigenous Banking, Black Customer Experience, Women in Enterprise and the 2SLGBTQ+ community work closely with internal business partners to help provide a comprehensive approach to serving customers from these diverse communities. The Bank is devoted to advancing its diversity and inclusion strategy to build a more inclusive and diverse culture at the Bank. The Bank’s third- party racial equity assessment on its U.S. and Canadian employment policies has been completed. It is in the process of reviewing key insights and recommendations and working towards publication. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Bank’s accounting policies and estimates are essential to understanding its r esults of operations and financial condition. A summary of the Bank’s significant accounting policies and estimates are presented in the Notes of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank’s critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee on a periodic basis. Critical accounting policies that require management’s judgment and estimates include the classification and measurement of financial assets, accounting for impairments of financial assets, accounting for leases, the determination of fair value of financial instruments, accounting for derecognition, the valuation of goodwill and other intangibles, accounting for employee benefits, accounting for income taxes, accounting for provisions, accounting for insurance, the consolidation of structured entities, and accounting for revenue from contract with customers. The Bank’s 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements have been pr epared in accordance with IFRS. For details of the Bank’s accounting policies under IFRS, refer to Note 2 of the Bank’s 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its r esults of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. 116 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS",

        "chunk": "Business Model Assessment The Bank determines its business models based on the objective under which its portfolios of financial assets are managed. Refer to Note 2 of the Bank’s 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the Bank’s business models. In determining its business models, the Bank considers the following: • Management’s intent and strategic objectives and the operation of the stated policies in practice; • The primary risks that affect the performance of the portfolio of assets and how these risks are managed; • How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to management; and • The frequency and significance of financial asset sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and the expected future sales activities. Sales in themselves do not determine the business model and are not considered in isolation. Instead, sales provide evidence about how cash flows are realized. A held-to-collect business model will be reassessed by the Bank to determine whether any sales are consistent with an objective of collecting contractual cash flows if the sales are more than insignificant in value or more than infrequent. Solely Payments of Principal and Interest Test In assessing whether contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI), the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains contractual terms that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that they would not be consistent with a basic lending arrangement. In making the assessment, the Bank considers the primary terms as follows and assesses if the contractual cash flows of the instrument continue to meet the SPPI test: • Performance-linked features; • Terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (non-recourse terms); • Prepayment and extension terms; • Leverage features; • Features that modify elements of the time value of money; and • Sustainability-linked features. Significant Increase in Credit Risk For retail exposures, criteria for assessing significant increase in credit risk are defined at the appropriate product or portfolio level and vary based on the exposure’s credit risk at origination. The criteria include relative changes in PD, absolute PD backstop, and delinquency backstop when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition has occurred when one of the criteria is met. For non-retail exposures, BRR is determined on an individual borrower basis using industry and sector specific credit risk models that are based on historical data. Current and forward-looking information that is specific to the borrower, industry, and sector is considered based on expert credit judgment. Criteria for assessing significant increase in credit risk are defined at the appropriate segmentation level and vary based on the BRR of the exposure at origination. Criteria include relative changes in BRR, absolute BRR backstop, and delinquency backstop when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition has occurred when one of the criteria is met. Measurement of Expected Credit Loss ECLs are recognized on the initial recognition of financial assets. Allowance for credit losses represents management’s unbiased estimate of the risk of default and ECLs on the financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. For retail exposures, ECLs are calculated as the product of PD, LGD, and EAD at each time step over the remaining expected life of the financial asset and discounted to the reporting date based on the EIR. PD estimates represent the forward-looking PD, updated quarterly based on the Bank’s historical experience, current conditions, and relevant forward-looking expectations over the expected life of the exposure to determine the lifetime PD curve. LGD estimates are determined based on historical charge-off events and recovery payments, current information about attributes specific to the borrower, and direct costs. Expected cash flows from collateral, guarantees, and other credit enhancements are incorporated in LGD if integral to the contractual terms. Relevant macroeconomic variables are incorporated in determining expected LGD. EAD represents the expected balance at default across the remaining expected life of the exposure. EAD incorporates forward-looking expectations about repayments of drawn balances and future draws where applicable. For non-retail exposures, ECLs are calculated based on the present value of cash shortfalls determined as the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. Lifetime PD is determined by mapping the exposure’s BRR to forward-looking PD over the expected life. LGD estimates are determined by mapping the exposure’s FRR to expected LGD which takes into account facility-specific characteristics such as collateral, seniority ranking of debt, and loan structure. Relevant macroeconomic variables are incorporated in determining expected PD and LGD. Expected cash flows are determined by applying the PD and LGD estimates to the contractual cash flows to calculate cash shortfalls over the expected life of the exposure. Forward-Looking Information In calculating ECLs, the Bank employs internally developed models that utilize parameters for PD, LGD, and EAD. Forward-looking macroeconomic factors including at the regional level are incorporated in the risk parameters as relevant. Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. Forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts are generated by TD Economics as part of the ECL process: A base economic forecast is accompanied with upside and downside estimates of realistically possible economic conditions by considering the sources of uncertainty around the base forecast. All macroeconomic forecasts are updated quarterly for each variable on a regional basis where applicable and incorporated as relevant into the quarterly modelling of base, upside and downside risk parameters used in the calculation of ECL scenarios and probability weighted ECLs. TD Economics will apply judgment to recommend probability weights to each forecast on a quarterly basis. The proposed macroeconomic forecasts and probability weightings are subject to robust management review and challenge process by a cross-functional committee that includes representation from TD Economics, Risk, Finance, and Business. ECLs calculated under each of the three forecasts are applied against the respective probability-weightings to determine the probability-weighted ECLs. Refer to Note 8 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the macroeconomic variables and ECL sensitivity. Expert Credit Judgment Management’s expert credit judgment is used to determine the best estimate for the qualitative component contributing to ECLs, based on an assessment of business and economic conditions, historical loss experience, loan portfolio composition, and other relevant indicators and forward-looking information that are not fully incorporated into the model calculation. There remains elevated economic uncertainty, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. The Bank applies judgment in determining the appropriate lease term on a lease-by-lease basis. All facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal option or not to exercise a termination option including investments in major leaseholds, branch performance and past business practice are considered. The periods covered by renewal or termination options are only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the Bank will exercise the options; management considers “reasonably certain” to be a high threshold. Changes in the economic environment or changes in the industry may impact the Bank’s assessment of lease term, and any changes in the Bank’s estimate of lease terms may have a material impact on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income.

The Bank determines its business models based on management's strategic objectives, risk management, and asset performance evaluation. It uses the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) test to assess whether financial assets' cash flows align with basic lending arrangements. The Bank evaluates significant increases in credit risk using criteria specific to retail and non-retail exposures, considering changes in probability of default (PD) and borrower risk ratings (BRR). ECLs are calculated using forward-looking models that incorporate PD, loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD), with adjustments for macroeconomic factors.

        "chunk": "In determining the carrying amount of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities, the Bank is required to estimate the incremental borrowing rate specific to each leased asset or portfolio of leased assets if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The Bank determines the incremental borrowing rate of each leased asset or portfolio of leased assets by incorporating the Bank’s creditworthiness, the security, term, and value of the ROU asset, and the economic environment in which the leased asset operates. The incremental borrowing rates are subject to change mainly due to changes in the macroeconomic environment. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets at the balance sheet date is based on their quoted market prices. For all other financial instruments not traded in an active market, fair value may be based on other observable current market transactions involving the same or similar instruments, without modification or repackaging, or is based on a valuation technique which maximizes the use of observable market inputs. Observable market inputs may include interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and option volatilities. Valuation techniques include comparisons with similar instruments where observable market prices exist, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. For certain complex or illiquid financial instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques in which current market transactions or observable market inputs are not available. Judgment is used when determining which valuation techniques to apply, liquidity considerations, and model inputs such as volatilities, correlations, spreads, discount rates, pre-payment rates, and prices of underlying instruments. Any imprecision in these estimates can affect the resulting fair value. Judgment is also used in recording valuation adjustments to model fair values to account for system limitations or measurement uncertainty, such as when valuing complex and less actively traded financial instruments. If the market for a complex financial instrument develops, the pricing for this instrument may become more transparent, resulting in refinement of valuation models. For example, CDOR cessation may also have an impact on the fair value of products that reference or use valuation models with CDOR inputs. Certain financial assets transferred may qualify for derecognition from the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. To qualify for derecognition, certain key determinations must be made, including whether the Bank’s rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have been retained or transferred and the extent to which the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets have been retained or transferred. If the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets, a decision must be made as to whether the Bank has retained control of the financial assets. Upon derecognition, the Bank will record a gain or loss on sale of those assets which is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset transferred and the sum of any cash proceeds received, including any financial assets received or financial liabilities assumed, and any cumulative gains or losses allocated to the transferred asset that had been recognized in AOCI. In determining the fair value of any financial assets received, the Bank estimates future cash flows by relying on estimates of the amount of interest that will be collected on the securitized assets, the yield to be paid to investors, the portion of the securitized assets that will be prepaid before their scheduled maturity, ECLs, the cost of servicing the assets, and the rate at which to discount these expected future cash flows. Actual cash flows may differ significantly from those estimated by the Bank. Retained interests are financial interests in transferred assets retained by the Bank. They are classified as trading securities and are initially recognized at relative fair value on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequently, the fair value of retained interests is determined by estimating the present value of future expected cash flows. Differences between the actual cash flows and the Bank’s estimated future cash flows are recognized in trading income (loss). These assumptions are subject to periodic reviews and may change due to significant changes in the economic environment. The recoverable amount of the Bank’s cash-generating units (CGUs) is determined from internally developed valuation models that consider various factors and assumptions such as forecasted earnings, growth rates, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. Management is required to use judgment in estimating the recoverable amount of CGUs, and the use of different assumptions and estimates in the calculations could influence the determination of the existence of impairment and the valuation of goodwill. Management believes that the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and supportable. Where possible, assumptions generated internally are compared to relevant market information. The carrying amounts of the Bank’s CGUs are determined by management using risk- based capital models to adjust net assets and liabilities by CGU. These models consider various factors including market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, including investment capital (comprised of goodwill and other intangibles). Any capital not directly attributable to the CGUs is held within the Corporate segment. The Bank’s capital oversight committees provide oversight to the Bank’s capital allocation methodologies. The projected benefit obligation and expense related to the Bank’s pension and post-retirement defined benefit plans are determined using multiple assumptions that may significantly influence the value of these amounts. Actuarial assumptions including discount rates, compensation increases, health care cost trend rates, and mortality rates are management’s best estimates and are reviewed annually with the Bank’s actuaries. The Bank develops each assumption using relevant historical experience of the Bank in conjunction with market-related data and considers if the market- related data indicates there is any prolonged or significant impact on the assumptions. The discount rate used to value the projected benefit obligation is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the plans’ specific cash flows. The other assumptions are also long-term estimates. All assumptions are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Differences between actual experiences and the assumptions, as well as changes in the assumptions resulting from changes in future expectations, result in remeasurement gains and losses which are recognized in OCI during the year and also impact expenses in future periods. The Bank is subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations in the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Bank maintains provisions for uncertain tax positions that it believes appropriately reflect the risk of tax positions under discussion, audit, dispute, or appeal with tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty. These provisions are made using the Bank’s best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on an assessment of all relevant factors, which are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. However, it is possible that at some future date, changes in these liabilities could result from audits by the relevant taxing authorities. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against which deductible temporary differences may be utilized. The amount of the deferred tax asset recognized and considered realizable could, however, be reduced if projected income is not achieved due to various factors, such as unfavourable business conditions. If projected income is not expected to be achieved, the Bank would decrease its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes can be realized. The magnitude of the decrease is significantly influenced by the Bank’s forecast of future profit generation, which determines the extent to which it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets. 118 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS",
        "summary": "The text discusses various financial estimation and valuation processes used by a bank, focusing on the determination of right-of-use (ROU) assets, lease liabilities, and fair value of financial instruments. Key points include:\n\n1. **Incremental Borrowing Rate**: The bank estimates this rate for leased assets by considering factors like creditworthiness and economic environment, which can change with macroeconomic conditions.\n\n2. **Fair Value Determination**: For actively traded instruments, fair value is based on market prices. For others, it relies on observable market transactions or valuation techniques using market inputs like interest rates and option volatilities. Complex instruments require judgment in choosing valuation techniques and inputs.\n\n3. **Derecognition of Financial Assets**: The bank assesses whether it retains or transfers risks and rewards of ownership to determine derecognition, impacting gains or losses recorded.\n\n4. **Valuation of Retained Interests**: These are initially recognized at fair value and adjusted based on estimated future cash flows, with differences affecting trading income.\n\n5. **Cash-Generating Units (CGUs)**: The recoverable amount is estimated using internal models and assumptions, with management judgment influencing impairment assessments and goodwill valuation.\n\n6. **Pension and Post-Retirement Plans**: Valuation involves assumptions like discount rates and mortality rates, with differences from actual experience affecting remeasurement gains/losses.\n\n7. **Taxation**: The bank maintains provisions for uncertain tax positions and recognizes deferred tax assets based on projected future profits, which can be adjusted if income forecasts change.\n\nOverall, the text highlights the reliance on estimates, assumptions, and judgment in financial reporting, with potential impacts from changes in economic conditions and market developments."

        "chunk": "Provisions arise when there is some uncertainty in the timing or amount of a loss in the future. Provisions are based on the Bank’s best estimate of all expenditures required to settle its present obligations, considering all relevant risks and uncertainties, as well as, when material, the effect of the time value of money. Many of the Bank’s provisions relate to various legal actions that the Bank is involved in during the ordinary course of business. Legal provisions require the involvement of both the Bank’s management and legal counsel when assessing the probability of a loss and estimating any monetary impact. Throughout the life of a provision, the Bank’s management or legal counsel may learn of additional information that may impact its assessments about the probability of loss or about the estimates of amounts involved. Changes in these assessments may lead to changes in the amount recorded for provisions. In addition, the actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts recognized. The Bank reviews its legal provisions on a case- by-case basis after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Bank’s experience, the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Certain of the Bank’s provisions relate to restructuring initiatives initiated by the Bank. Restructuring provisions require management’s best estimate, including forecasts of economic conditions. Throughout the life of a provision, the Bank may become aware of additional information that may impact the assessment of amounts to be incurred. Changes in these assessments may lead to changes in the amount recorded for restructuring provisions. The assumptions used in establishing the Bank’s insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are based on best estimates of possible outcomes. For property and casualty insurance, the ultimate cost of claims liabilities is estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques in accordance with Canadian accepted actuarial practices. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in the future, in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate claims cost that present the most likely outcome taking into account all the uncertainties involved. For life and health insurance, actuarial liabilities consider all future policy cash flows, including premiums, claims, and expenses required to administer the policies. Critical assumptions used in the measurement of life and health insurance contract liabilities are determined by the appointed actuary. Management judgment is required when assessing whether the Bank should consolidate an entity. For instance, it may not be feasible to determine if the Bank controls an entity solely through an assessment of voting rights for certain structured entities. In these cases, judgment is required to establish whether the Bank has decision-making power over the key relevant activities of the entity and whether the Bank has the ability to use that power to absorb significant variable returns from the entity. If it is determined that the Bank has both decision-making power and significant variable returns from the entity, judgment is also used to determine whether any such power is exercised by the Bank as principal, on its own behalf, or as agent, on behalf of another counterparty. Assessing whether the Bank has decision-making power includes understanding the purpose and design of the entity in order to determine its key economic activities. In this context, an entity’s key economic activities are those which predominantly impact the economic performance of the entity. When the Bank has the current ability to direct the entity’s key economic activities, it is considered to have decision- making power over the entity. The Bank also evaluates its exposure to the variable returns of a structured entity in order to determine if it absorbs a significant proportion of the variable returns the entity is designed to create. As part of this evaluation, the Bank considers the purpose and design of the entity in order to determine whether it absorbs variable returns from the structured entity through its contractual holdings, which may take the form of securities issued by the entity, derivatives with the entity, or other arrangements such as guarantees, liquidity facilities, or lending commitments. If the Bank has decision-making power over the entity and absorbs significant variable returns from the entity, it then determines if it is acting as principal or agent when exercising its decision-making power. Key factors considered include the scope of its decision-making power; the rights of other parties involved with the entity, including any rights to remove the Bank as decision-maker or rights to participate in key decisions; whether the rights of other parties are exercisable in practice; and the variable returns absorbed by the Bank and by other parties involved with the entity. When assessing consolidation, a presumption exists that the Bank exercises decision-making power as principal if it is also exposed to significant variable returns, unless an analysis of the factors above indicates otherwise. The decisions above are made with reference to the specific facts and circumstances relevant for the structured entity and related transaction(s) under consideration. The Bank applies judgment to determine the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations which affects the timing of revenue recognition, by evaluating the pattern in which the Bank transfers control of services promised to the customer. A performance obligation is satisfied over time when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the Bank performs the service. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is generally recognized using the time-elapsed method which is based on time elapsed in proportion to the period over which the service is provided, for example, personal deposit account bundle fees. The time-elapsed method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of control for these services as control is transferred evenly to the customer when the Bank provides a stand-ready service or effort is expended evenly by the Bank to provide a service over the contract period. In contracts where the Bank has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Bank’s performance completed to date, the Bank recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice. The Bank satisfies a performance obligation at a point in time if the customer obtains control of the promised services at that date. Determining when control is transferred requires the use of judgment. For transaction-based services, the Bank determines that control is transferred to the customer at a point in time when the customer obtains substantially all of the benefits from the service rendered and the Bank has a present right to payment, which generally coincides with the moment the transaction is executed. The Bank exercises judgment in determining whether costs incurred in connection with acquiring new revenue contracts would meet the requirement to be capitalized as incremental costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with customers. INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM PHASE 2 Effective November 1, 2020, the Bank early adopted the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 and no transitional adjustment was required. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 addresses issues affecting financial reporting when changes are made to contractual cash flows of financial instruments or hedging relationships as a result of IBOR reform. The amendments permit modification to financial assets, financial liabilities and lessee lease liabilities required as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and made on an economically equivalent basis to be accounted for by updating the EIR prospectively. If the modification does not meet the practical expedient requirements, existing IFRS requirements are applied. Relief is also provided for an entity’s hedge accounting relationships in circumstances where changes to hedged items and hedging instruments arise as a result of IBOR reform. The amendments enable entities to amend the formal designation and documentation of a hedging relationship to reflect these changes without discontinuing the hedging relationship or designating a new hedging relationship. Permitted changes include redefining the hedged risk to reference an ARR (contractually or non-contractually specified), amending the description of the hedged item and hedging instrument to reflect the ARR, and amending the description of how the entity will assess hedge effectiveness. Hedging relationships within the scope of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 are the same as those within the scope of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 1. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 also amended IFRS 7, introducing expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the risks arising TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 119",
        "summary": "The text discusses various financial provisions and judgments made by a bank, focusing on legal, restructuring, insurance, and consolidation aspects. Provisions are made for uncertain future losses, particularly in legal actions, requiring management and legal counsel's assessment. Restructuring provisions depend on economic forecasts, while insurance liabilities are estimated using actuarial techniques. The bank also exercises judgment in consolidating entities, assessing control and exposure to variable returns. Revenue recognition involves determining when performance obligations are satisfied, either over time or at a point in time. Additionally, the text covers the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2, which addresses financial reporting issues due to IBOR reform, allowing modifications to financial instruments and hedging relationships without discontinuing them, and requiring expanded disclosures."

        "chunk": "from IBOR reform, how an entity is managing those risks, its progress in completing the transition to ARRs, and how it is managing the transition. The global benchmark rate reform initiative to transition from IBOR benchmarks (such as CDOR to ARRs) may r esult in market dislocation and have other adverse consequences to the Bank, its customers, market participants, and the financial services industry. Market risks arise because the new reference rates are likely to differ from the prior benchmark rates resulting in differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions, require alternative hedging strategies, or affect the Bank’s capital and liquidity planning and management. In Canada specifically, the expected discontinuation of the Bankers’ Acceptance (BA) lending model, which is responsible for creating the BA investment securities that are sold to money market investors, might also have impacts to the Bank’s investment portfolio holdings and impact related earnings. In order to manage these risks, the Bank has established an enterprise-wide, cross functional initiative with senior executive oversight to evaluate and monitor the impact of the market, financial, operational, legal, technology and other risks on its products, services, systems, models, documents, processes, and risk management frameworks with the intention of managing the impact through appropriate mitigating actions, but such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate against the impact of all such risks. Following previous announcements by various regulators, the publication has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and eur o London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings, as well as the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings effective December 31, 2021. From June 30, 2023, all remaining USD LIBOR tenors have either ceased or are published only on a synthetic basis for the use in legacy contracts that have no other fallback solution. Six-month and twelve-month CDOR tenors ceased to be published effective May 17, 2021, while the remaining tenors of CDOR (one-month, two-month, and three-month) will cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. In July 2023, the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate working group introduced a “no new CDOR or Banker’s Acceptance loan” milestone date of November 1, 2023 to facilitate a tapered transition for the loan market by reducing the volume of loans that need to be remediated ahead of CDOR’s cessation. The Bank has incorporated these developments into its benchmark rate r eform plan. To ensure an orderly transition, the Bank continues to monitor developments and incorporate global working groups’ and regulators’ best practice guidance on transition activities. These activities include, but are not limited to, making available new products referencing ARRs, preparing to cease the issuance of the residual CDOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy contracts by incorporating appropriate fallback language and preparing for overall operational readiness. The Bank continues to make progress on its CDOR transition plan. Current and Future Changes in Accounting Policies The following amendments to an accounting standard have been adopted by the Bank for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. Amendments to IAS 12 – Income Taxes On May 23, 2023, the IASB issued International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules , which amends IAS 12, Income Taxes. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from the requirements to recognize and disclose information about deferred taxes related to the implementation of Pillar Two model rules. The Bank has applied the temporary mandatory exception in jurisdictions in which the rules have been substantively enacted, which is effective immediately and is retrospective. The Bank has assessed that the retrospective application has no current impact on the Bank’s consolidated results as at October 31, 2023. Effective for reporting periods beginning on or after November 1, 2023, additional disclosur e of current tax expense (recovery) and other information related to Pillar Two income tax exposures are required. The following standard has been issued but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’ s Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4), and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023, for the Bank. OSFI’ s related Advisory precludes early adoption. The Bank will apply the standard retrospectively with restatement of comparatives, where it will recognize the cumulative effect of adopting the standard as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance as of November 1, 2022. The Bank will transition to IFRS 17 by primarily applying the full r etrospective approach. This approach results in the measurement of insurance contracts as if IFRS 17 had always applied to them. Under IFRS 17, the measurement of insurance contracts includes a risk adjustment, which represents the compensation the Bank requires for bearing the uncertainty related to non-financial risk in its fulfilment of insurance contracts. The risk adjustment replaces the provision for adverse deviation under IFRS 4 and is expected to result in a lower valuation of insurance liabilities. When onerous contract groups are identified, the expected losses related to those contract groups shall be recorded in income. This results in an earlier recognition of losses compared to IFRS 4. The Bank estimates a decrease to insurance-related liabilities and an incr ease to retained earnings of approximately $0.1 billion after-tax at November 1, 2022. IFRS 17 requires cash flows to be measured at their present value using a discount factor that is r eflective of the characteristics of the liability, the discount factor is no longer tied to the yield of the securities supporting insurance reserves. In adopting IFRS 17, the Bank will apply transitional guidance to reclassify certain securities supporting insurance reserves from financial assets designated at FVTPL to FVOCI and vice versa to minimize accounting mismatches arising from the application of the new discount factor under IFRS 17. The reclassification will be retrospectively applied on November 1, 2023 and will result in the movement of cumulative unrealized losses between accumulated other comprehensive income and retained earnings. The Bank’s adoption of IFRS 17 is supported by a robust governance structur e. The Executive Steering Committee includes representation from the Insurance business, Finance, Actuaries, Risk, Technology, and project management teams. Updates are also provided to the TD insurance subsidiary boards, Risk Committee, and Audit Committee of the Bank. 120 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS",

Based on that evaluation, the Bank’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Bank’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2023. MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER The Bank’ s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal contr ol over financial reporting for the Bank. The Bank’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Bank; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and that receipts and expenditures of the Bank are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Bank’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Bank’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. The Bank’s management has used the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Contr ol – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to assess, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment management has concluded that as at October 31, 2023, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the applicable criteria. The effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by the independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP , a registered public accounting firm that has also audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bank as of, and for the year ended October 31, 2023. Their Report on Internal Controls under Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023. During the year and quarter ended October 31, 2023, there have been no changes in the Bank’s policies and procedures and other processes that comprise its internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting.

        "summary": "The analysis of net interest income changes between 2023 and 2022 reveals that the net interest income increased by CAD 2,591 million. This increase is attributed to both changes in average volume and average interest rates. Interest income from interest-earning assets rose significantly, with notable contributions from non-trading securities in the U.S. (CAD 5,927 million) and residential mortgages in Canada (CAD 4,759 million). Interest expense also increased, primarily due to higher costs associated with business and government deposits in Canada (CAD 9,626 million) and the U.S. (CAD 5,979 million). Overall, the increase in net interest income was driven by a larger rise in interest income compared to interest expenses."

        "chunk": "Financial and Banking Terms Adjusted Results: Non-GAAP financial measures used to assess each of the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note”, from reported results. The items of note relate to items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance. Allowance for Credit Losses: Represent expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. Allowance for credit losses consists of Stage 3 allowance for impaired financial assets and Stage 2 and Stage 1 allowance for performing financial assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals, and impacted by foreign exchange. Amortized Cost: The amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization, using EIRM, of any differences between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. Assets under Administration (AUA): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers where the Bank provides services of an administrative nature, such as the collection of investment income and the placing of trades on behalf of the clients (where the client has made his or her own investment selection). The majority of these assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets under Management (AUM): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers, managed by the Bank, where the Bank has discretion to make investment selections on behalf of the client (in accordance with an investment policy). In addition to the TD family of mutual funds, the Bank manages assets on behalf of individuals, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments and foundations. These assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Some assets under management that are also administered by the Bank are included in assets under administration. Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP): A form of commercial paper that is collateralized by other financial assets. Institutional investors usually purchase such instruments in order to diversify their assets and generate short-term gains. Asset-Backed Securities (ABS): A security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or “backed”) by a specified pool of underlying assets. Average Common Equity: Average common equity for the business segments reflects the average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Average Interest-Earning Assets: A non-GAAP financial measure that depicts the Bank’s financial position, and is calculated as the average carrying value of deposits with banks, loans and securities based on daily balances for the period ending October 31 in each fiscal year. Basic Earnings per Share (EPS): A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted basic EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Basis Points (bps): A unit equal to 1/100 of 1%. Thus, a 1% change is equal to 100 basis points. Book Value per Share: A measure calculated by dividing common shareholders’ equity by number of common shares at the end of the period. Carrying Value: The value at which an asset or liability is carried at on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO): They are collateralized debt obligations consisting of mortgage-backed securities that are separated and issued as different classes of mortgage pass-through securities with different terms, interest rates, and risks. CMOs by private issuers are collectively referred to as non-agency CMOs. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: This is a primary Basel III capital measure comprised mainly of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. Regulatory deductions made to arrive at the CET1 Capital include goodwill and intangibles, unconsolidated investments in banking, financial, and insurance entities, deferred tax assets, defined benefit pension fund assets, and shortfalls in allowances. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio: CET1 Capital ratio represents the predominant measure of capital adequacy under Basel III and equals CET1 Capital divided by RWA. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): A measure of growth over multiple time periods from the initial investment value to the ending investment value assuming that the investment has been compounding over the time period. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA): CVA represents a capital charge that measures credit risk due to default of derivative counterparties. This charge requires banks to capitalize for the potential changes in counterparty credit spread for the derivative portfolios. Diluted EPS: A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusting for the effect of all potentially dilutive common shares. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Payout Ratio: A ratio represents the percentage of Bank’s earnings being paid to common shareholders in the form of dividends and is calculated by dividing common dividends by net income available to common shareholders. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Yield: A ratio calculated as the dividend per common share for the year divided by the daily average closing stock price during the year. Effective Income Tax Rate: A rate and performance indicator calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes as a percentage of net income before taxes. Adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated in the same manner using adjusted results. Effective Interest Rate (EIR): The rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The calculation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts. Effective Interest Rate Method (EIRM): A technique for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument’s book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Under EIRM, the effective interest rate, which is a key component of the calculation, discounts the expected future cash inflows and outflows expected over the life of a financial instrument. Efficiency Ratio: The efficiency ratio measures operating efficiency and is calculated by taking the non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue. A lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted non-interest expenses and total revenue. Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF): Established by the Financial Stability Board in May 2012, comprised of banks, analysts, investors, and auditors, with the goal of enhancing the risk disclosures of banks and other financial institutions. Expected Credit Losses (ECLs): ECLs are the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions that impact the Bank’s credit risk assessment. Fair Value: The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. 130 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 GLOSSARY",

        "chunk": "Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Under IFRS 9, if the asset passes the contractual cash flows test (named SPPI), the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classified. If the instrument is being held to collect contractual cash flows, that is, if it is not expected to be sold, it is measured as amortized cost. If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is measured at FVOCI. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Under IFRS 9, the classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI) and a business model assessment. Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in profit or loss. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): A U.S. government corporation which provides deposit insurance guaranteeing the safety of a depositor’s accounts in member banks. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in receivership (failed banks). Forward Contracts: Over-the-counter contracts between two parties that oblige one party to the contract to buy and the other party to sell an asset for a fixed price at a future date. Futures: Exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Hedging: A risk management technique intended to mitigate the Bank’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other market factors. The elimination or reduction of such exposure is accomplished by engaging in capital markets activities to establish offsetting positions. Impaired Loans: Loans where, in management’s opinion, there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent that the Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. Loss Given Default (LGD): It is the amount of the loss the Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a loan, which is expressed as a percentage of exposure at default. Mark-to-Market (MTM): A valuation that reflects current market rates as at the balance sheet date for financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Master Netting Agreements: Legal agreements between two parties that have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default or termination of any one contract. Net Corporate Expenses: Non-interest expenses related to corporate service and control groups which are not allocated to a business segment. Net Interest Margin: A non-GAAP ratio calculated as net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to measure performance. This metric is an indicator of the profitability of the Bank’s earning assets less the cost of funding. Adjusted net interest margin is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net interest income. Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC): Instruments (preferred shares and subordinated debt) that contain a feature or a provision that allows the financial institution to either permanently convert these instruments into common shares or fully write-down the instrument, in the event that the institution is no longer viable. Notional: A reference amount on which payments for derivative financial instruments are based. Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI): The regulator of Canadian federally chartered financial institutions and federally administered pension plans. Options: Contracts in which the writer of the option grants the buyer the future right, but not the obligation, to buy or to sell a security, exchange rate, interest rate, or other financial instrument or commodity at a predetermined price at or by a specified future date. Price-Earnings Ratio: A ratio calculated by dividing the closing share price by EPS based on a trailing four quarters to indicate market performance. Adjusted price-earnings ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted EPS. Probability of Default (PD): It is the likelihood that a borrower will not be able to meet its scheduled repayments. Provision for Credit Losses (PCL): Amount added to the allowance for credit losses to bring it to a level that management considers adequate to reflect expected credit-related losses on its portfolio. Return on Common Equity (ROE): The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity, utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. Adjusted ROE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Return on Risk-weighted Assets: Net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average risk-weighted assets. Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a percentage of average Tangible common equity. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Both measures can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA): Assets calculated by applying a regulatory risk- weight factor to on and off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight factors are established by the OSFI to convert on and off-balance sheet exposures to a comparable risk level. Securitization: The process by which financial assets, mainly loans, are transferred to structures, which normally issue a series of asset-backed securities to investors to fund the purchase of loans. Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI): IFRS 9 requires that the following criteria be met in order for a financial instrument to be classified at amortized cost: • The entity’s business model relates to managing financial assets (such as bank trading activity), and, as such, an asset is held with the intention of collecting its contractual cash flows; and • An asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI. Swaps: Contracts that involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payment obligations and currencies on a notional principal for a specified period of time. Tangible common equity (TCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as common shareholders’ equity less goodwill, imputed goodwill, and intangibles on an investment in Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other acquired intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. It can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Taxable Equivalent Basis (TEB): A calculation method (not defined in GAAP) that increases revenues and the provision for income taxes on certain tax-exempt securities to an equivalent before-tax basis to facilitate comparison of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Tier 1 Capital Ratio: Tier 1 Capital represents the more permanent forms of capital, consisting primarily of common shareholders’ equity, retained earnings, preferred shares and innovative instruments. Tier 1 Capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 Capital divided by RWA. Total Capital Ratio: Total Capital is defined as the total of net Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital. Total Capital ratio is calculated as Total Capital divided by RWA. Total Shareholder Return (TSR): The total return earned on an investment in TD’s common shares. The return measures the change in shareholder value, assuming dividends paid are reinvested in additional shares. Trading-Related Revenue: A non-GAAP financial measure that is the total of trading income (loss), net interest income on trading positions, and income from financial instruments designated at FVTPL that are managed within a trading portfolio. Trading-related revenue (TEB) in the Wholesale Banking segment is also a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in the same manner, including TEB adjustments. Both are used for measuring trading performance. Value-at-Risk (VaR): A metric used to monitor and control overall risk levels and to calculate the regulatory capital required for market risk in trading activities. VaR measures the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of time.

        "summary": "The text provides definitions and explanations of various financial terms and concepts, primarily related to banking and financial instruments. Key insights include:\n\n1. **IFRS 9 Classification**: Financial instruments are classified based on the contractual cash flows test (SPPI) and business model assessment. Instruments held to collect cash flows are measured at amortized cost, while those held for both collection and potential sale are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Instruments not meeting these criteria are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\n\n2. **Risk Management and Hedging**: Hedging is used to mitigate exposure to market fluctuations, while Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a metric for monitoring risk levels.\n\n3. **Financial Metrics**: Various metrics are used to assess financial performance, including Net Interest Margin, Return on Common Equity (ROE), and Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE).\n\n4. **Capital and Regulatory Measures**: Concepts like Tier 1 Capital Ratio, Total Capital Ratio, and Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) are used to evaluate a bank's capital adequacy and regulatory compliance.\n\n5. **Financial Instruments**: The text explains derivatives like forward contracts, futures, options, and swaps, as well as concepts like securitization and impaired loans.\n\n6. **Regulatory Bodies**: The roles of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the U.S. and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI) are outlined.\n\n7. **Non-GAAP Measures**: Several non-GAAP financial measures are discussed, such as Trading-Related Revenue and Taxable Equivalent Basis (TEB), which provide alternative ways to assess financial performance.\n\nOverall, the text serves as a glossary of financial terms relevant to banking and financial reporting."

International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, as well as the requirements of the Bank Act (Canada), and related regulations have been applied and management has exercised its judgment and made best estimates where appropriate. The Bank’s accounting system and related internal controls are designed, and supporting procedures maintained, to provide reasonable assurance that financial records are complete and accurate, and that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition. These supporting procedures include the careful selection and training of qualified staff, the establishment of organizational structures providing a well-defined division of responsibilities and accountability for performance, and the communication of policies and guidelines of business conduct throughout the Bank. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting as at October 31, 2023, using the framework found in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework. Based upon this assessment, management has concluded that as at October 31, 2023, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. The Bank’s Board of Directors, acting through the Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors, oversees management’s responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviews the Consolidated Financial Statements and recommends them to the Board for approval. Other responsibilities of the Audit Committee include monitoring the Bank’s system of internal control over the financial reporting process and making recommendations to the Board and shareholders regarding the appointment of the external auditor. The Bank’s Chief Auditor, who has full and free access to the Audit Committee, conducts an extensive program of audits. This program supports the system of internal control and is carried out by a professional staff of auditors. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada, makes such examination and enquiry into the affairs of the Bank as deemed necessary to ensure that the provisions of the Bank Act (Canada), having reference to the safety of the depositors, are being duly observed and that the Bank is in sound financial condition. Ernst & Young LLP , the independent auditors appointed by the shareholders of the Bank, have audited the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting as at October 31, 2023, in addition to auditing the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of the same date. Their reports, which expressed unqualified opinions, can be found on the following pages of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Ernst & Young LLP have full and free access to, and meet periodically with, the Audit Committee to discuss their audit and matters arising therefrom, such as, comments they may have on the fairness of financial reporting and the adequacy of internal controls. Bharat B. Masrani Group President and Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Tran Group Head and Chief Financial Officer Toronto, Canada November 29, 2023 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS 133 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT To the Shareholders and Directors of The Toronto-Dominion Bank Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of The Toronto- Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries (TD), which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheets as at October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of TD as at October 31, 2023 and 2022, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of TD in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the year ended October 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Allowance for credit losses Key audit matter TD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to the allowance for credit losses in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, TD recognized $8,189 million in allowances for credit losses on its consolidated balance sheet using an expected credit loss model (ECL). The ECL is an unbiased and probability- weighted estimate of credit losses expected to occur in the future, which is based on the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) or the expected cash shortfall relating to the underlying financial asset. The ECL is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes incorporating the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and future economic forecasts. ECL allowances are measured at amounts equal to either (i) 12-month ECL; or (ii) lifetime ECL for those financial instruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition or when there is objective evidence of impairment. Auditing the allowance for credit losses was complex and required the application of significant judgment and involvement of specialists because of the sophistication of the models, the forward-looking nature of the key assumptions, and the inherent interrelationship of the critical variables used in measuring the ECL. Key areas of judgment include evaluating: (i) the models and methodologies used for measuring both the 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses; (ii) the assumptions used in the ECL scenarios including forward-looking information (FLI) and assigning probability weighting; (iii) the determination of SICR; and (iv) the assessment of the qualitative component applied to the modelled ECL based on management’s expert credit judgment. How our audit addressed the key audit matter We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management’s controls over the allowance for credit losses. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the development and validation of models and selection of appropriate inputs including economic forecasting, determination of non-retail borrower risk ratings, the integrity of the data used including the associated controls over relevant information technology (IT) systems, and the governance and oversight over the modelled results and the use of expert credit judgment. To test the allowance for credit losses, our audit procedures included, amongst others, involving our credit risk specialists to assess whether the methodology and assumptions, including management’s SICR triggers, used in significant models that estimate the ECL across various portfolios are consistent with the requirements of IFRS. This included reperforming the model validation procedures for a sample of models to evaluate whether management’s conclusions were appropriate. With the assistance of our economic specialists, we evaluated the models, methodology and process used by management to develop the FLI variable forecasts for each scenario and the scenario probability weights. For a sample of FLI variables, we compared management’s FLI to independently derived forecasts and publicly available information. On a sample basis, we recalculated the ECL to test the mathematical accuracy of management’s models. We tested the completeness and accuracy of data used in measuring the ECL by agreeing to source documents and systems and evaluated a sample of management’s non-retail borrower risk ratings against TD’s risk rating policy. With the assistance of our credit risk specialists, we also evaluated management’s methodology and governance over the application of expert credit judgment by evaluating that the amounts recorded were reflective of underlying credit quality and macroeconomic trends. We also assessed the adequacy of disclosures related to the allowance for credit losses. Fair value measurement of derivatives Key audit matter TD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to the fair value measurement of derivatives in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, TD has derivative assets of $87,382 million and derivative liabilities of $71,640 million recorded at fair value. Certain of these derivatives are complex and illiquid and require valuation techniques that may include complex models and non- observable inputs, requiring management’s estimation and judgment. 134 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",
        "summary": "The management of The Toronto-Dominion Bank is responsible for ensuring the integrity and reliability of its Consolidated Financial Statements, adhering to International Financial Reporting Standards and Canadian regulations. The Bank has implemented internal controls to safeguard assets and ensure accurate financial records, which were assessed as effective as of October 31, 2023. The Audit Committee, composed of independent directors, oversees financial reporting and internal controls, with support from the Chief Auditor and external auditors, Ernst & Young LLP. Ernst & Young provided unqualified opinions on the Bank's financial statements and internal controls. Key audit matters included the allowance for credit losses and fair value measurement of derivatives, both requiring significant judgment and complex modeling. The audit involved evaluating management's controls, methodologies, and assumptions, with the assistance of specialists, to ensure compliance with IFRS and the accuracy of financial reporting."

        "chunk": "Auditing the valuation of certain derivatives required the application of significant auditor judgment and involvement of valuation specialists in assessing the complex models and non-observable inputs used, including any significant valuation adjustments applied. Certain valuation inputs used to determine fair value that may be non-observable include volatilities, correlations, and credit spreads. The valuation of certain derivatives is sensitive to these inputs as they are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How our audit addressed the key audit matter We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management’s controls, including the associated controls over relevant IT systems, over the valuation of TD’s derivative portfolio. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the controls over the suitability and mechanical accuracy of models used in the valuation of derivatives, controls over management’s independent assessment of fair values, including the integrity of data used in the valuation such as the significant inputs noted above, and controls over the review of significant valuation adjustments applied. To test the valuation of these derivatives, our audit procedures included, amongst others, an evaluation of the methodologies and significant inputs used by TD. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we performed an independent valuation for a sample of derivatives to assess the modelling assumptions and significant inputs used to estimate the fair value, which involved obtaining significant inputs from independent external sources, where available. For a sample of valuation adjustments, we utilized the assistance of our valuation specialists to evaluate the methodology applied and performed a recalculation of these adjustments. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the fair value measurement of derivatives. Measurement of provision for uncertain tax positions Key audit matter TD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to income taxes in Note 3 and Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements. As a financial institution operating in multiple jurisdictions, TD is subject to complex and constantly evolving tax legislation. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. TD uses significant judgment in i) determining whether it is probable that TD will have to make a payment to tax authorities upon their examination of certain uncertain tax positions and ii) measuring the amount of the provision. Auditing TD’s provision for uncertain tax positions involved the application of judgment and is based on interpretation of tax legislation and jurisprudence. How our audit addressed the key audit matter We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management’s controls over TD’s provision for uncertain tax positions. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the controls over the assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and management’s process to measure the provision for uncertain tax positions. With the assistance of our tax professionals, we assessed the technical merits and the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions. Our audit procedures included, amongst others, using our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate TD’s interpretations and assessment of tax laws with respect to uncertain tax positions. We assessed the implications of correspondence received by TD from the relevant tax authorities and evaluated income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to uncertain tax positions. Other Information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises: • Management’s Discussion and Analysis; and • The information, other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, in the 2023 Annual Report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, and in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. We obtained Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the 2023 Annual Report prior to the date of this auditor’s report. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact in this auditor’s report. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing TD’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate TD or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing TD’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of TD’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on TD’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS 135",
        "summary": "The audit of TD's financial statements involved significant judgment, particularly in valuing derivatives and assessing uncertain tax positions. For derivatives, auditors evaluated complex models and non-observable inputs like volatilities and credit spreads, which are sensitive to future economic conditions. They tested management's controls and performed independent valuations with the help of specialists. For uncertain tax positions, auditors assessed TD's judgment in determining potential tax liabilities, using their expertise in tax laws and evaluating third-party advice. The audit also involved reviewing management's disclosures and ensuring the financial statements were free from material misstatements.

Chartered Professional Accountants Licensed Public Accountants Toronto, Canada November 29, 2023 To the Shareholders and Directors of The Toronto-Dominion Bank Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Changes in Equity, and Cash Flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of TD as at October 31, 2023 and 2022, its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), TD’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 29, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of TD’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on TD’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to TD in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements, and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we performed an independent valuation for a sample of derivatives to assess the modelling assumptions and significant inputs used to estimate the fair value, which involved obtaining significant inputs from independent external sources, where available. For a sample of valuation adjustments, we utilized the assistance of our valuation specialists to evaluate the methodology applied and performed a recalculation of these adjustments. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the fair value measurement of derivatives. Measurement of provision for uncertain tax positions Description of the Matter TD describes its significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions in relation to income taxes in Note 3 and Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements. As a financial institution operating in multiple jurisdictions, TD is subject to complex and constantly evolving tax legislation. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. TD uses significant judgment in i) determining whether it is probable that TD will have to make a payment to tax authorities upon their examination of certain uncertain tax positions and ii) measuring the amount of the provision. Auditing TD’s provision for uncertain tax positions involved the application of judgment and is based on interpretation of tax legislation and jurisprudence. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management’s controls over TD’s provision for uncertain tax positions. The controls we tested included, amongst others, the controls over the assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and management’s process to measure the provision for uncertain tax positions. With the assistance of our tax professionals, we assessed the technical merits and the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions. Our audit procedures included, amongst others, using our knowledge of, and experience with, the application of tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate TD’s interpretations and assessment of tax laws with respect to uncertain tax positions. We assessed the implications of correspondence received by TD from the relevant tax authorities and evaluated income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to uncertain tax positions. Chartered Professional Accountants Licensed Public Accountants We have served as TD’s sole auditor since 2006. Prior to 2006, we or our predecessor firm have served as joint auditor with various other firms since 1955. Toronto, Canada November 29, 2023 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS 137",
        "summary": "The text outlines the audit procedures and findings related to three key financial areas for TD Bank Group: the allowance for credit losses, the fair value measurement of derivatives, and the provision for uncertain tax positions. \n\n1. **Allowance for Credit Losses**: The audit focused on understanding and testing management's controls over credit loss allowances, including model development, economic forecasting, and data integrity. The audit involved credit risk specialists to ensure the methodology and assumptions, such as SICR triggers, were consistent with IFRS standards. The audit also assessed the application of expert credit judgment and the adequacy of related disclosures.\n\n2. **Fair Value Measurement of Derivatives**: The audit evaluated the controls over the valuation of TD's derivative portfolio, which involves complex models and non-observable inputs like volatilities and credit spreads. Valuation specialists were involved to independently assess the models and inputs used. The audit also checked the adequacy of disclosures regarding derivative valuations.\n\n3. **Provision for Uncertain Tax Positions**: The audit examined the controls over TD's provision for uncertain tax positions, which involves significant judgment due to complex tax legislation. Tax professionals assessed the technical merits of tax positions and the recorded amounts. The audit also evaluated TD's interpretations of tax laws and the adequacy of related disclosures.\n\nOverall, the audit involved significant judgment and specialist involvement to ensure compliance with relevant standards and the accuracy of financial disclosures."

        "chunk": "To the Shareholders and Directors of The Toronto-Dominion Bank Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited The Toronto-Dominion Bank’s (TD) internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, TD maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of TD as of October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Changes in Equity and Cash Flows for the years then ended, and the related notes, and our report dated November 29, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion TD’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting contained in the accompanying Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on TD’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to TD in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on TD's consolidated financial statements for 2023 and 2022. The report highlights that internal control over financial reporting is designed to ensure the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards, though it acknowledges inherent limitations that may not prevent or detect all misstatements."

        "chunk": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS | The Toronto-Dominion Bank is a bank chartered under the Bank Act (Canada). The shareholders of a bank are not, as shareholders, liable for any liability, act, or default of the bank except as otherwise provided under the Bank Act (Canada). The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (“TD” or the“Bank”). The Bank was formed through the amalgamation on February 1, 1955, of The Bank of Toronto (chartered in 1855) and The Dominion Bank (chartered in 1869). The Bank is incorporated and domiciled in Canada with its registered and principal business offices located at 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario. TD serves customers in four business segments operating in a number of locations in key financial centres around the globe: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting principles followed by the Bank have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including the accounting requirements of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. These Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared using the accounting policies as described in Note 2. Certain comparative amounts have been revised to conform with the presentation adopted in the current period. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires that management make judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as further described in Note 3. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future confirming events occur. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bank were approved and authorized for issue by the Bank’s Board of Directors, in accordance with a recommendation of the Audit Committee, on November 29, 2023. The risk management policies and procedures of the Bank are provided in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the 2023 MD&A, relating to market, liquidity, and insurance risks, are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements, as permitted by IFRS. NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES | The Consolidated Financial Statements include the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of the Bank and its subsidiaries including certain structured entities which it controls. The Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. All intercompany transactions, balances, and unrealized gains and losses on transactions are eliminated on consolidation. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are corporations or other legal entities controlled by the Bank, generally through directly holding more than half of the voting power of the entity. Control of subsidiaries is determined based on the power exercisable through ownership of voting rights and is generally aligned with the risks and/or returns (collectively referred to as “variable returns”) absorbed from subsidiaries through those voting rights. As a result, the Bank controls and consolidates subsidiaries when it holds the majority of the voting rights of the subsidiary, unless there is evidence that another investor has control over the subsidiary. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered in assessing whether the Bank controls an entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the Bank obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date when control ceases to exist. The Bank may consolidate certain subsidiaries where it owns 50% or less of the voting rights. Most of those subsidiaries are structured entities as described in the following section. Structured Entities Structured entities are entities created to accomplish a narrow and well- defined objective. Structured entities may take the form of a corporation, trust, partnership, or unincorporated entity. They are often created with legal arrangements that impose limits on the decision-making powers of their governing board, trustee, or management. Structured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Bank and the structured entity indicates that the Bank controls the entity. When assessing whether the Bank has to consolidate a structured entity, the Bank evaluates three primary criteria in order to conclude whether, in substance: • The Bank has the power to direct the activities of the structured entity that have the most significant impact on the entity’s variable returns; • The Bank is exposed to significant variable returns arising from the entity; and • The Bank has the ability to use its power to affect the variable returns to which it is exposed. Consolidation conclusions are reassessed at the end of each financial reporting period. The Bank’s policy is to consider the impact on consolidation of all significant changes in circumstances, focusing on the following: • Substantive changes in ownership, such as the purchase or disposal of more than an insignificant interest in an entity; • Changes in contractual or governance arrangements of an entity; • Additional activities undertaken, such as providing a liquidity facility beyond the original terms or entering into a transaction not originally contemplated; • Changes in the financing structure of an entity; and • Changes in the rights to exercise power over an entity. Entities over which the Bank has significant influence are associates and entities over which the Bank has joint control are joint ventures. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an investee, but is not control or joint control over these entities. Significant influence is presumed to exist where the Bank holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of an entity. Significant influence may also exist where the Bank holds less than 20% of the voting rights and has influence over financial and operating policy-making processes, through board representation and significant commercial arrangements. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheet initially at cost and increased or decreased to recognize the Bank’s share of the profit or loss of the associate or joint venture, capital transactions, including the receipt of any dividends, and write-downs to reflect any impairment in the value of such entities. These increases or decreases, together with any gains and losses realized on disposition, are reported on the Consolidated Statement 144 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",

The carrying amount of the investments also includes the Bank’s share of the investee’s other comprehensive income or loss, which is reported in the relevant section of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. At each balance sheet date, the Bank assesses whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in an associate or joint venture is impaired. The Bank calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the higher of fair value or value-in-use and its carrying value. Cash and due from banks consist of cash and amounts due fr om banks which are issued by investment grade financial institutions. These amounts are due on demand or have an original maturity of three months or less. Revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration the Bank expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Bank recognizes revenue when it transfers contr ol of a good or a service to a customer at a point in time or over time. The determination of when performance obligations are satisfied requires the use of judgment. Refer to Note 3 for further details. The Bank identifies contracts with customers subject to IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which create enforceable rights and obligations. The Bank determines the performance obligations based on distinct services promised to the customers in the contracts. The Bank’s contracts generally have a term of one year or less, consist of a single performance obligation, and the performance obligations generally r eflect services. For each contract, the Bank determines the transaction price, which includes estimating variable consideration and assessing whether the price is constrained. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the amount will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the amount of variable consideration is subsequently resolved. As such, the estimate of the variable consideration is constrained until the end of the invoicing period. The uncertainty is generally resolved at the end of the r eporting period and as such, no significant judgment is required when recognizing variable consideration in revenues. The Bank’s receipt of payment from customers generally occurs subsequent to the satisfaction of performance obligations or a short time thereafter. As such, the Bank has not recognized any material contract assets (unbilled receivables) or contract liabilities (deferred r evenues) and there is no significant financing component associated with the consideration due to the Bank. When another party is involved in the transfer of services to a customer, an assessment is made to evaluate whether the Bank is the principal such that revenues are reported on a gross basis or the agent such that revenues ar e reported on a net basis. The Bank is the principal when it controls the services in the contract promised to the customer before they are transferred. Control is demonstrated by the Bank being primarily responsible for fulfilling the transfer of the services to the customer, having discretion in establishing pricing of the services, or both. Investment and securities services Investment and securities services income includes asset management fees, administration and commission fees, and investment banking fees. The Bank recognizes asset management and administration fees based on time elapsed, which depicts the rendering of investment management and related services over time. The fees are primarily calculated based on average daily or point in time assets under management (AUM) or assets under administration (AUA) depending on the investment mandate. Commission fees include sales, trailer and brokerage commissions. Sales and br okerage commissions are generally recognized at a point in time when the transaction is executed. Trailer commissions are r ecognized over time and are generally calculated based on the average daily net asset value of the fund during the period. Investment banking fees include advisory fees and underwriting fees and are generally recognized at a point in time upon successful completion of the engagement. Credit fees Credit fees include liquidity fees, restructuring fees, letter of credit fees, and loan syndication fees. Liquidity , restructuring, and letter of credit fees are recognized in income over the period in which the service is pr ovided. Loan syndication fees are generally recognized at a point in time upon completion of the financing placement. Service charges Service charges income is earned on personal and commercial deposit accounts and consists of account fees and transaction-based service charges. Account fees relate to account maintenance activities and are recognized in income over the period in which the service is provided. Transaction-based service charges ar e recognized as earned at a point in time when the transaction is complete. Card services Card services income includes interchange income as well as card fees such as annual and transactional fees. Interchange income is recognized at a point in time when the transaction is authorized and funded. Card fees are recognized as ear ned at the transaction date with the exception of annual fees, which are recognized over a twelve-month period. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 1 The Bank adopted Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, Amendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39) and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7) (Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 1), including the applicable amendments to IFRS 7 relating to hedge accounting, in the fourth quarter of 2019. Under these amendments, it is assumed that the hedged interest rate benchmark is not altered and thus hedge accounting continues through to the date of replacement of the existing interest rate benchmark with its alternative reference rate (ARR). The Bank is not required to discontinue hedge accounting if the actual results of the hedge do not meet the effectiveness requirements as a result of interbank offered rate (IBOR) reform. Refer to Note 11 for disclosures related to the Bank’s hedge accounting relationships impacted by IBOR reform. Refer to Note 3 for details of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2, Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) and IFRS 16, Leases (IFRS 16) (Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2), issued on August 27, 2020 and early adopted by the Bank on November 1, 2020. Classification and Measur ement of Financial Assets The Bank classifies its financial assets into the following categories: • Amortized cost; • Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); • Held-for-trading; • Non-trading fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and • Designated as measured at FVTPL. The Bank recognizes financial assets on a settlement date basis, except for derivatives and securities, which are recognized on a trade date basis. Debt Instruments The classification and measurement for debt instruments is based on the Bank’s business models for managing its financial assets and whether the contractual cash flows repr esent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Refer to Note 3 for judgment with respect to the determination of the Bank’ s business models and whether contractual cash flows represent SPPI. The Bank has determined its business models as follows: • Held-to-collect: the objective is to collect contractual cash flows; • Held-to-collect-and-sell: the objective is both to collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets; and • Held-for-sale and other business models: the objective is neither of the above. The Bank performs the SPPI test for financial assets held within the held- to-collect and held-to-collect-and-sell business models.

In a basic lending arrangement, interest includes only consideration for time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks, and a reasonable profit margin. Debt Securities and Loans Measured at Amortized Cost Debt securities and loans held within a held-to-collect business model where their contractual cash flows pass the SPPI test are measured at amortized cost. The carrying amount of these financial assets is adjusted by an allowance for cr edit losses recognized and measured as described in the Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model section of this Note, as well as any write-offs and unearned income which includes prepaid interest, loan origination fees and costs, commitment fees, loan syndication fees, and unamortized discounts or premiums. Interest income is recognized using EIRM. The effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The calculation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and costs are considered to be adjustments to the loan yield and are recognized in interest income over the term of the loan. Commitment fees are recognized in credit fees over the commitment period when it is unlikely that the commitment will be called upon; otherwise, they are recognized in interest income over the term of the resulting loan. Loan syndication fees are recognized in credit fees upon completion of the financing placement unless the yield on any loan retained by the Bank is less than that of other comparable lenders involved in the financing syndicate. In such cases, an appropriate portion of the fee is recognized as a yield adjustment in interest income over the term of the loan. Debt Securities and Loans Measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income Debt securities and loans held within a held-to-collect-and-sell business model where their contractual cash flows pass the SPPI test are measured at FVOCI. Fair value changes ar e recognized in other comprehensive income, except for impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument’s amortized cost, which are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Interest income is recognized using EIRM. The expected credit loss (ECL) allowance is recognized and measured as described in the Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model section of this Note. When the financial asset is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to income and recognized in other income (loss). Financial Assets Held-for-Trading The held-for-sale business model includes financial assets held within a trading portfolio, which have been originated, acquired, or incurred principally for the purpose of selling in the near term, or if they form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which ther e is evidence of short-term profit-taking. Financial assets held within this business model consist of trading securities, trading loans, as well as certain securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements. Trading portfolio assets are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in trading income (loss). Transaction costs are expensed as incurr ed. Dividends are recognized on the ex-dividend date and interest is recognized on an accrual basis. Both dividends and interest are included in interest income. Non-Trading Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss Non-trading financial assets measured at FVTPL include financial assets held within the held-for-sale and other business models, for example debt securities and loans managed on a fair value basis. Financial assets held within the held-to-collect or held-to-collect-and-sell business models that do not pass the SPPI test are also classified as non-trading financial assets measured at FVTPL. Changes in fair value as well as any gains or losses r ealized on disposal are recognized in other income (loss). Interest income from debt instruments is included in interest income on an accrual basis. Financial Assets Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss Debt instruments in a held-to-collect or held-to-collect-and-sell business model can be designated at initial recognition as measured at FVTPL, provided the designation can eliminate or significantly r educe an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise from measuring these financial assets on a different basis. The FVTPL designation is available only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained. Once financial assets are designated at FVTPL, the designation is irrevocable. Changes in fair value as well as any gains or losses realized on disposal are recognized in other income (loss). Interest income from these financial assets is included in interest income on an accrual basis. Customers’ Liability under Acceptances Acceptances represent a form of negotiable short-term debt issued by customers, which the Bank guarantees for a fee. Revenue is recognized on an accrual basis. The potential obligation of the Bank is reported as a liability under Acceptances on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Bank’s r ecourse against the customer in the event of a call on any of these commitments is reported as an asset of the same amount. Equity Instruments Equity investments are required to be measured at FVTPL, except wher e the Bank has elected at initial recognition to irrevocably designate an equity investment, held for purposes other than trading, at FVOCI. If such an election is made, the fair value changes, including any associated foreign exchange gains or losses, are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not subsequently reclassified to net income, including upon disposal. Realized gains and losses are transferred directly to retained earnings upon disposal. Consequently, there is no review required for impairment. Dividends will normally be recognized in interest income unless the dividends represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Gains and losses on trading and non-trading equity investments measured at FVTPL are included in trading income (loss) and other income (loss), respectively. Classification and Measurement for Financial Liabilities The Bank classifies its financial liabilities into the following categories: • Held-for-trading; • Designated at FVTPL; and • Other liabilities. Financial Liabilities Held-for-Trading Financial liabilities are held within a trading portfolio if they have been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term, or form part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that ar e managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Financial liabilities held-for-trading are primarily trading deposits, securitization liabilities at fair value, obligations related to securities sold short and certain obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements. Trading portfolio liabilities are accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value as well as any gains or losses realized on disposal recognized in trading income (loss). Transaction costs ar e expensed as incurred. Interest is recognized on an accrual basis in interest expense. Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss Certain financial liabilities may be designated at FVTPL at initial recognition. To be designated at FVTPL, financial liabilities must meet one of the following criteria: (1) the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measur ement or recognition inconsistency; (2) the financial liabilities or a group of financial assets and financial liabilities are managed, and their performance is evaluated, on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy; or (3) the instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives unless a) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract, or b) it is clear with little or no analysis that separation of the embedded derivative from the financial instrument is prohibited.

Financial liabilities designated at FVTPL are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in fair value as well as any gains or losses realized on disposal recognized in other income (loss), except for the amount of change in fair value attributable to changes in the Bank’s own credit risk, which is presented in other compr ehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassified to net income upon derecognition of the financial liability; instead, they are transferred directly to retained earnings. Changes in fair value attributable to changes in the Bank’s own credit risk are measured as the difference between: (i) the period-over-period change in the pr esent value of the expected cash flows using an all-in discount curve reflecting both the interest rate benchmark curve and the Bank’s own credit curve; and (ii) the period-over-period change in the present value of the same expected cash flows using a discount curve based solely on the interest rate benchmark curve. For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts that are designated at FVTPL, the full change in fair value of the liability is recognized in other income (loss). Interest is recognized on an accrual basis in interest expense. Other Financial Liabilities Deposits Deposits, other than deposits included in a trading portfolio and deposits designated at FVTPL, are accounted for at amortized cost. Accrued inter est on deposits is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest, including capitalized transaction costs, is recognized on an accrual basis using EIRM as Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Subordinated Notes and Debentures Subor dinated notes and debentures are accounted for at amortized cost. Accrued interest on subordinated notes and debentures is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest, including capitalized transaction costs, is recognized on an accrual basis using EIRM as Inter est expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Reclassification of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except for financial assets for which the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets. Such reclassifications of financial assets are expected to be rare in practice. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The ECL model applies to financial assets, including loans and debt securities measur ed at amortized cost, loans and debt securities measured at FVOCI, loan commitments, and financial guarantees that are not measured at FVTPL. The ECL model consists of three stages: Stage 1 – T welve-month ECLs for performing financial assets, Stage 2 – Lifetime ECLs for financial assets that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, and Stage 3 – Lifetime ECLs for financial assets that are credit-impair ed. ECLs are the difference between all the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows the Bank expects to receive, discounted at the original EIR. If a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition, impairment is measured as lifetime ECLs. Otherwise, impairment is measured as twelve-month ECLs which represent the portion of lifetime ECLs that are expected to occur based on default events that are possible within twelve months after the reporting date. If credit quality improves in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since initial recognition is no longer considered significant, the loss allowance reverts to being measured based on twelve-month ECLs. Significant Increase in Credit Risk For retail exposures, significant increase in credit risk is assessed based on changes in the twelve-month probability of default (PD) since initial recognition, using a combination of individual and collective information that incorporates borrower and account specific attributes and relevant forward-looking macr oeconomic variables. For non-retail exposures, significant increase in credit risk is assessed based on changes in the internal risk rating (borrower risk ratings (BRR)) since initial recognition. Refer to the shaded areas of the “Managing Risk” section of the 2023 MD&A for further details on the Bank’s 21-point BRR scale to risk levels. For both r etail and non-retail exposures, delinquency backstop when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due is also used in assessing significant increase in credit risk. The Bank defines default as delinquency of 90 days or more for most r etail products and BRR of 9 for non-retail exposures. Exposures ar e considered credit-impaired and migrate to Stage 3 when the definition of default is met or when there is objective evidence that there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent the Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. When assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the initial recognition of a financial asset, the Bank considers all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort about past events, current conditions, and forecast of futur e economic conditions. Refer to Note 3 for additional details. Measurement of Expected Credit Losses ECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and consider reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions that impact the Bank’ s credit risk assessment. Expected life is the maximum contractual period the Bank is exposed to credit risk, including extension options for which the borrower has unilateral right to exercise. For certain financial instruments that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment, and the Bank’s contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Bank’s exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period, ECLs are measured over the period the Bank is exposed to credit risk. For example, ECLs for credit cards are measured over the borrowers’ expected behavioural life, incorporating survivorship assumptions and borrower-specific attributes. The Bank leverages its Advanced Internal Ratings-Based models used for regulatory capital purposes and incorporates adjustments where appropriate to calculate ECLs. Forward-Looking Information and Expert Credit Judgment Forward-looking information is considered when determining significant incr ease in credit risk and measuring ECLs. Forward-looking macroeconomic factors are incorporated in the risk parameters as r elevant. Qualitative factors that are not already considered in the quantitative models are incorporated by applying expert credit judgment in determining the final ECLs. Refer to Note 3 for additional details. Modified Loans In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties, the Bank may grant certain modifications to the terms and conditions of a loan. Modifications may include payment deferrals, extension of amortization periods, rate r eductions, principal forgiveness, debt consolidation, forbearance and other modifications intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. The Bank has policies in place to determine the appropriate r emediation strategy based on the individual borrower. If the Bank determines that a modification results in expiry of cash flows, the original asset is derecognized and a new asset is recognized based on the new contractual terms. Significant increase in credit risk is assessed relative to the risk of default on the date of modification. If the Bank determines that a modification does not r esult in derecognition, significant increase in credit risk is assessed based on the risk of default at initial recognition of the original asset. Expected cash flows arising from the modified contractual terms ar e considered when calculating ECLs for the modified asset. For loans that were modified while having lifetime ECLs, the loans can revert to having twelve-month ECLs after a period of performance and improvement in the borrower’s financial condition.

Key insights include:\n\n1. **FVTPL Designation**: Financial liabilities designated at FVTPL are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in other income, except for changes due to the bank's own credit risk, which are recorded in other comprehensive income and transferred to retained earnings.\n\n2. **Amortized Cost Accounting**: Deposits and subordinated notes are accounted for at amortized cost, with interest recognized on an accrual basis.\n\n3. **Reclassification**: Financial assets and liabilities are generally not reclassified after initial recognition, except in rare cases where the bank changes its business model.\n\n4. **Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Model**: The ECL model applies to various financial assets and consists of three stages based on credit risk: Stage 1 (12-month ECLs), Stage 2 (lifetime ECLs for increased credit risk), and Stage 3 (lifetime ECLs for credit-impaired assets). Significant increases in credit risk are assessed using changes in probability of default and internal risk ratings.\n\n5. **Measurement of ECLs**: ECLs are calculated as the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls, considering past events, current conditions, and future forecasts. The bank uses advanced internal models and expert judgment to incorporate forward-looking information.\n\n6. **Modified Loans**: When loans are modified due to borrower financial difficulties, the bank assesses whether the modification results in derecognition. ECLs for modified loans consider expected cash flows from new terms, and loans can revert to 12-month ECLs after improvement in the borrower's condition.\n\nOverall, the text outlines the bank's approach to managing financial liabilities and assets, emphasizing fair value accounting, credit risk assessment, and the application of the ECL model."

        "chunk": "Allowance for Loan Losses, Excluding Acquired Credit-Impaired Loans The allowance for loan losses represents management’s calculation of probability-weighted ECLs in the lending portfolios, including any off- balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses for lending portfolios reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which includes credit-related allowances for residential mortgages, consumer instalment and other personal, credit car d, business and government loans, and customers’ liability under acceptances, is deducted from Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The allowance for loan losses for loans measured at FVOCI is presented on the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. The allowance for loan losses for off-balance sheet instruments, which relates to certain guarantees, letters of credit, and undrawn lines of credit, is recognized in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Allowances for lending portfolios reported on the balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures are calculated using the same methodology. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses and decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals. Each quarter, allowances are reassessed and adjusted based on any changes in management’s estimate of ECLs. Loan losses on impaired loans in Stage 3 continue to be recognized by means of an allowance for loan losses until a loan is written off. A loan is written off against the related allowance for loan losses when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Non-retail loans are generally written off when all r easonable collection efforts have been exhausted, such as when a loan is sold, when all security has been realized, or when all security has been resolved with the receiver or bankruptcy court. Non-real estate retail loans are generally written off when contractual payments are 180 days past due, or when a loan is sold. Real-estate secured retail loans are generally written off when the security is realized. The time period over which the Bank performs collection activities on the contractual amount outstanding of financial assets that are written off varies from one jurisdiction to another and generally spans between less than one year to five years. Allowance for Credit Losses on Debt Securities The allowance for credit losses on debt securities represents management’s calculation of probability-weighted ECLs. Debt securities measured at amortized cost are presented net of the allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The allowance for credit losses on debt securities measured at FVOCI are pr esented on the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. The allowance for credit losses is increased by the provision for credit losses and decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals. Acquired Performing Loans Acquired performing loans are initially measured at fair value, which considers incurred and expected future credit losses estimated at the acquisition date and also reflects adjustments based on the acquired loan’s interest rate in comparison to current market rates. On acquisition, twelve- month ECLs are recognized on the acquired performing loans, resulting in the carrying amount being lower than fair value. Acquired performing loans are subsequently accounted for at amortized cost based on their contractual cash flows and any acquisition related discount or premium, including credit- related discounts, is considered to be an adjustment to the loan yield and is recognized in interest income using EIRM over the term of the loan, or the expected life of the loan for acquired performing loans with revolving terms. Acquired Credit-Impaired Loans When loans are acquired with evidence of incurred credit loss where it is probable at the purchase date that the Bank will be unable to collect all contractually required principal and interest payments, they are generally considered to be acquired cr edit-impaired (ACI) loans, with no ECLs recognized on acquisition. ACI loans are identified as impaired at acquisition based on specific risk characteristics of the loans, including past due status, performance history, and recent borrower credit scores. ACI loans are accounted for based on the present value of expected cash flows as opposed to their contractual cash flows. The Bank determines the fair value of these loans at the acquisition date by discounting expected cash flows at a discount rate that reflects factors a market participant would use when determining fair value, including management assumptions relating to default rates, loss severities, the amount and timing of prepayments, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. With respect to certain individually significant ACI loans, accounting is applied individually at the loan level. The remaining ACI loans are aggregated provided they are acquired in the same fiscal quarter and have common risk characteristics. Aggr egated loans are accounted for as a single asset with aggregated cash flows and a single composite interest rate. Subsequent to acquisition, the Bank regularly reassesses and updates its cash flow estimates for changes to assumptions relating to default rates, loss severities, the amount and timing of prepayments, and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected cash flows trigger the recognition of additional impairment, which is measured based on the present value of the revised expected cash flows discounted at the loan’s EIR as compared to the carrying value of the loan. The ECL in excess of the initial credit-related discount is recorded through the provision for credit losses. Interest income on ACI loans is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted EIR to the amortized cost of ACI loans. The Bank classifies financial instruments that it issues as either financial liabilities, equity instruments, or compound instruments. Issued instruments that are mandatorily redeemable or convertible into a variable number of the Bank’s common shares at the holder’s option are classified as liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Dividend or interest payments on these instruments are recognized in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Issued instruments ar e classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other financial assets to redeem or convert these instruments. Such instruments, if not mandatorily redeemable or convertible into a variable number of the Bank’s common shares at the holder’s option, are classified as equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of equity instruments ar e included in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax. Dividends and distributions on these instruments are recognized as a reduction in equity. Compound instruments are comprised of both liability and equity components in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. The liability component is initially measured at fair value with any residual amount assigned to the equity component. Issuance costs are allocated proportionately to the liability and equity components. Common shares, preferred shar es, and other equity instruments issued and held by the Bank are classified as treasury instruments in equity, and the cost of these instruments is recorded as a reduction in equity. Upon the sale of treasury instruments, the dif ference between the sale proceeds and the cost of the instruments is recorded in or against contributed surplus. The Bank issues guarantee contracts that require payments to be made to guaranteed parties based on: (1) changes in the underlying economic characteristics relating to an asset or liability of the guaranteed party; (2) failure of another party to perform under an obligating agreement; or (3) failure of another third party to pay its indebtedness when due. Guarantees are initially measured and recor ded at their fair value. The fair value of a guarantee liability at initial recognition is normally equal to the present value of the guarantee fees received over the life of the contract. The Bank’s release from risk is recognized over the term of the guarantee using a systematic and rational amortization method. If a guarantee meets the definition of a derivative, it is carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and reported as a derivative asset or derivative liability at fair value. Guarantees that are considered derivatives are over-the-counter (OTC) credit derivative contracts designed to transfer the credit risk in an underlying financial instrument from one counterparty to another . Derivatives are instruments that derive their value from changes in underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, commodity prices, equities, or other financial or non-financial measures. Such instruments include interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity , and credit derivative contracts. The Bank uses these instruments for trading and non-trading purposes. Derivatives are carried at their fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 148 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",

        "chunk": "Derivatives Held for Trading Purposes The Bank enters into trading derivative contracts to meet the needs of its customers, to provide liquidity and market-making related activities, and in certain cases, to manage risks r elated to its trading portfolios. The realized and unrealized gains or losses on trading derivatives are recognized in trading income (loss). Derivatives Held for Non-trading Purposes Non-trading derivatives are primarily used to manage interest rate, foreign exchange, and other market risks of the Bank’s traditional banking activities. When derivatives are held for non-trading purposes and when the transactions meet the hedge accounting r equirements of IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39), they are presented as non-trading derivatives and receive hedge accounting treatment, as appropriate. Certain derivative instruments that are held for economic hedging purposes, and do not meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39, are also presented as non-trading derivatives with the change in fair value of these derivatives recognized in non-interest income. Hedging Relationships Hedge Accounting The Bank has an accounting policy choice to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 or IAS 39. The Bank has made the decision to continue applying the IAS 39 hedge accounting r equirements and complies with the revised annual hedge accounting disclosures as required by the related amendments to IFRS 7. At the inception of a hedging relationship, the Bank documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, its risk management objective, and its strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Bank also requir es a documented assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether or not the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships are highly effective in offsetting the changes attributable to the hedged risks in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. In order to be considered highly effective, the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly and inversely correlated such that the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will substantially offset the effects of the hedged exposure throughout the term of the hedging relationship. If a hedging relationship becomes ineffective, it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and any subsequent change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in Non-interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in fair value relating to the derivative component excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness ar e recognized in Net interest income or Non-interest income, as applicable, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. When derivatives are designated in hedge accounting relationships, the Bank classifies them either as: (1) hedges of the changes in fair value of recognized assets, liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedges); (2) hedges of the variability in highly probable futur e cash flows attributable to recognized assets, liabilities or forecast transactions (cash flow hedges); or (3) hedges of net investments in foreign operations (net investment hedges). Interest Rate Benchmark Reform A hedging relationship is affected by IBOR reform if the reform gives rise to uncertainties about (a) the interest rate benchmark (contractually or non-contractually specified) designated as a hedged risk; and/or (b) the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or of the hedging instrument. For such hedging r elationships, the following temporary exceptions apply during the period of uncertainty: • When assessing whether a forecast transaction is highly probable or expected to occur, it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based is not altered as a result of IBOR reform; • When assessing whether a hedge is expected to be highly effective, it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, is not altered as a result of IBOR reform; • A hedge is not required to be discontinued if the actual results of the hedge are outside of a range of 80–125 per cent as a result of IBOR reform; and • For a hedge of a non-contractually specified benchmark portion of interest rate risk, the requirement that the risk component is separately identifiable need only be met at the inception of the hedging relationship. Fair Value Hedges The Bank’s fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments due to movements in market inter est rates. The change in the fair value of the derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, as well as the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in net interest income to the extent that the hedging r elationship is effective. Any change in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship is recognized immediately in non-interest income. The cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item (the basis adjustment) is amortized to Net interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income based on a recalculated EIR over the r emaining expected life of the hedged item, with amortization beginning no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk. Where the hedged item has been derecognized, the basis adjustment is immediately released to Net interest income or Non-interest income, as applicable, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Cash Flow Hedges The Bank is exposed to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and equity price risks. The amounts and timing of futur e cash flows are projected for each hedged exposure on the basis of their contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge is initially recognized in other comprehensive income. The change in fair value of the derivative r elating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in non-interest income. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) are reclassified to Net interest income or Non-interest income, as applicable, on the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period during which the hedged item affects income. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in AOCI at that time remains in AOCI until the forecast transaction impacts the Consolidated Statement of Income. When a for ecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in AOCI is immediately reclassified to Net interest income or Non-interest income, as applicable, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Net Investment Hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similar to cash flow hedges. The change in fair value on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion is r ecognized in other comprehensive income. The change in fair value of the hedging instrument relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in non-interest income. Gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income upon the disposal or partial disposal of the investment in the foreign operation. The Bank designates derivatives and non-derivatives (such as foreign currency deposit liabilities) as hedging instruments in net investment hedges. Embedded Derivatives Derivatives may be embedded in financial liabilities or other host contracts. Embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks ar e not closely related to those of the host instrument, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the combined contract is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income, such as held-for-trading or designated at FVTPL. These embedded derivatives, which are bifurcated from the host contract, TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS 149",

Trading derivatives are used for customer needs, liquidity, and market-making, with gains or losses recognized in trading income. Non-trading derivatives manage risks like interest rate and foreign exchange, with some qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39. The Bank opts to apply IAS 39 for hedge accounting, documenting hedging relationships and assessing their effectiveness. It uses fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges, with specific accounting treatments for each. The text also addresses the impact of the IBOR reform on hedging relationships, providing temporary exceptions during periods of uncertainty. Additionally, it discusses the treatment of embedded derivatives, which are separated from host contracts if their characteristics differ significantly."

The Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars. Items included in the financial statements of each of the Bank’s entities are measured using their functional curr ency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that differs from an entity’s functional currency ar e translated into the functional currency of the entity at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates. Income and expenses are translated into an entity’s functional currency at average exchange rates for the period. Translation gains and losses are included in non-interest income except for equity investments designated at FVOCI where unrealized translation gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income. Foreign operations are those with a functional currency other than Canadian dollars. For the purpose of translation into the Bank’s presentation currency , all assets and liabilities are first measured in the functional currency of the foreign operation and subsequently, translated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Unrealized translation gains and losses relating to these foreign operations, net of gains or losses arising from net investment hedges and applicable income taxes, are included in other comprehensive income. Translation gains and losses in AOCI are recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income upon the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation. The investment balance of foreign entities accounted for by the equity method, including the Bank’s investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation, is translated into Canadian dollars using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date with exchange gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income. Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amount presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, only if the Bank currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the r ecognized amounts, and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. In all other situations, assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price, as evidenced by the fair value of the consideration given or received. The best evidence of fair value is quoted prices in active markets. When there is no active market for the instrument, the fair value may be based on other observable current market transactions involving the same or similar instruments, without modification or r epackaging, or based on a valuation technique which maximizes the use of observable market inputs. When financial assets and liabilities have offsetting market risks or credit risks, the Bank applies a measurement exception, as described in Note 5 under Portfolio Exception. The value determined from application of the portfolio exception must be allocated to the individual financial instruments within the gr oup to arrive at the fair value of an individual financial instrument. Balance sheet offsetting presentation requirements, as described above under the Offsetting of Financial Instruments section of this Note, are then applied, if applicable. Valuation adjustments reflect the Bank’s assessment of factors that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Bank recognizes various types of valuation adjustments including, but not limited to, adjustments for bid-offer spr eads, adjustments for the unobservability of inputs used in pricing models, and adjustments for assumptions about risk, such as the creditworthiness of either counterparty and market implied unsecured funding costs and benefits for OTC derivatives. If there is a difference between the initial transaction price and the value based on a valuation technique, the difference is referr ed to as inception profit or loss. Inception profit or loss is recognized upon initial recognition of the instrument only if the fair value is based on observable inputs. When an instrument is measured using a valuation technique that utilizes significant non-observable inputs, it is initially valued at the transaction price, which is considered the best estimate of fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, any differ ence between the transaction price and the value determined by the valuation technique at initial recognition is recognized as non-observable inputs become observable. If the fair value of a financial asset measur ed at fair value becomes negative, it is recognized as a financial liability until either its fair value becomes positive, at which time it is recognized as a financial asset, or until it is extinguished. Financial Assets The Bank derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to that asset have expir ed. Derecognition may also be appropriate wher e the contractual right to receive future cash flows from the asset have been transferred, or where the Bank retains the rights to future cash flows from the asset, but assumes an obligation to pay those cash flows to a third party subject to certain criteria. When the Bank transfers a financial asset, it is necessary to assess the extent to which the Bank has retained the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferr ed asset. If substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been retained, the Bank continues to recognize the financial asset and also recognizes a financial liability for the consideration received. Certain transaction costs incurred are also capitalized and amortized using EIRM. If substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been transferred, the Bank will derecognize the financial asset and recognize separately as assets or liabilities any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer. The Bank determines whether substantially all the risks and rewards have been transferred by quantitatively comparing the variability in cash flows before and after the transfer. If the variability in cash flows does not change significantly as a result of the transfer, the Bank has retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. If the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, the Bank derecognizes the financial asset wher e it has relinquished control of the financial asset. The Bank is considered to have relinquished control of the financial asset where the transferee has the practical ability to sell the transferred financial asset. Where the Bank has retained control of the financial asset, it continues to recognize the financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the financial asset. Under these circumstances, the Bank usually retains the rights to future cash flows relating to the asset through a residual interest and is exposed to some degree of risk associated with the financial asset. The derecognition criteria are also applied to the transfer of part of an asset, rather than the asset as a whole, or to a group of similar financial assets in their entirety, when applicable. If transferring a part of an asset, it must be a specifically identified cash flow , a fully proportionate share of the asset, or a fully proportionate share of a specifically identified cash flow. Securitization Securitization is the process by which financial assets are transformed into securities. The Bank securitizes financial assets by transferring those financial assets to a third party and as part of the securitization, certain financial assets may be retained and may consist of an interest-only strip and, in some cases, a cash r eserve account (collectively referred to as “retained interests”). If the transfer qualifies for derecognition, a gain or loss on sale of the financial assets is recognized immediately in other income (loss) after considering the effect of hedge accounting on the assets sold, if applicable. The amount of the gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset transferred and the sum of any cash proceeds received, the fair value of any financial asset received or financial liability assumed, and any cumulative gain or loss allocated to the transferred asset that had been recognized in AOCI. To determine the value of the retained interest initially recorded, the previous carrying value of the transferred asset is allocated between the amount derecognized from the balance sheet and the retained interest recorded, in proportion to their relative fair values on the date of transfer. Subsequent to initial recognition, as market prices are generally not available for retained interests, fair value is determined by estimating the present 150 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",

Refer to Note 3 for assumptions used by management in determining the fair value of retained interests. Retained interest is classified as trading securities with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in trading income (loss). Where the Bank retains the servicing rights, the benefits of servicing are assessed against market expectations. When the benefits of servicing are mor e than adequate, a servicing asset is recognized. Similarly, when the benefits of servicing are less than adequate, a servicing liability is recognized. Servicing assets and servicing liabilities are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently carried at amortized cost. Financial Liabilities The Bank derecognizes a financial liability when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled, or expires. If an existing financial liability is replaced by another financial liability fr om the same lender on substantially different terms or where the terms of the existing liability are substantially modified, the original liability is derecognized and a new liability is recognized with the difference in the respective carrying amounts recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Securities Purchased Under Reverse Repurchase Agreements, Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements, and Securities Borrowing and Lending Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements involve the purchase of securities by the Bank under agreements to r esell the securities at a future date. These agreements are treated as collateralized lending transactions whereby the Bank takes possession of the purchased securities, but does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership. The Bank monitors the market value of the purchased securities relative to the amounts due under the reverse repurchase agreements, and when necessary, requires transfer of additional collateral. In the event of counterparty default, the agreements provide the Bank with the right to liquidate the collateral held and offset the proceeds against the amount owing from the counterparty. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities by the Bank to counterparties under agreements to repur chase the securities at a future date. These agreements do not result in the risks and rewards of ownership being relinquished and are treated as collateralized borrowing transactions. The Bank monitors the market value of the securities sold relative to the amounts due under the repurchase agreements, and when necessary, transfers additional collateral or may require counterparties to return the collateral pledged. Certain transactions that do not meet derecognition criteria are also included in obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements. Refer to Note 9 for further details. Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and obligations related to securities sold under repur chase agreements are initially recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the respective prices at which the securities were originally acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. Subsequently, the agreements are measured at amortized cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, plus accrued interest, except when they are held-for-trading or are designated at FVTPL. Interest earned on reverse repurchase agreements and interest incurred on repurchase agreements is determined using EIRM and is included in Interest income and Interest expense, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in fair value on reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements that are held-for-trading or are designated at FVTPL are included in Trading income (loss) or in Other income (loss) on the Consolidated Statement of Income. In securities lending transactions, the Bank lends securities to a counterparty and receives collateral in the form of cash or securities. If cash collateral is received, the Bank r ecords the cash along with an obligation to return the cash as Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where securities are received as collateral, the Bank does not record the collateral on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In securities borrowing transactions, the Bank borrows securities from a counterparty and pledges either cash or securities as collateral. If cash is pledged as collateral, the Bank records the transaction as Securities pur chased under reverse repurchase agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. If securities are pledged as collateral, the securities remain on the Bank’ s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where securities are pledged or received as collateral, security borrowing fees and security lending income are r ecorded in Non-interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income over the term of the transaction. Where cash is pledged or received as collateral, interest received or incurred is included in Interest income and Interest expense, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Physical commodities purchased or sold with an agreement to sell or repurchase the physical commodities at a later date at a fixed price, ar e also included in securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, respectively, if the derecognition criteria are not met. These instruments are measured at fair value. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is carried at its initial cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) or a group of CGUs that is expected to benefit fr om the synergies of the business combination, regardless of whether any assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to the CGU or group of CGUs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Each CGU or group of CGUs, to which goodwill is allocated, represents the lowest level within the Bank at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than an operating segment. If the composition of a CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated changes as a result of the sale of a business, restructuring or other changes, the goodwill is reallocated to the units affected using a relative value approach, unless the Bank can demonstrate that some other method better reflects the goodwill associated with the units affected. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually and when an event or change in cir cumstances indicates that the carrying amount may be impaired. When impairment indicators ar e present, the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGUs, which is the higher of its estimated fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use, is determined. If the carrying amount of the CGU or group of CGUs is higher than its recoverable amount, an impairment loss exists. The impairment loss is recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income and cannot be reversed in future periods. Intangible assets represent identifiable non-monetary assets and are acquired either separately or through a business combination, or inter nally generated software. The Bank’s intangible assets consist primarily of core deposit intangibles, credit card related intangibles, software intangibles, and other intangibles. Intangible assets are initially recognized at cost, or at fair value if acquired through a business combination, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives (4 to 15 years) proportionate to their expected economic benefits, except for software which is amortized over its estimated useful life (3 to 7 years) on a straight-line basis. In respect of internally generated software, development costs are capitalized only if the costs can be measured reliably, the asset is technically feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Bank intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development of the asset. Research costs are expensed as incurred. The Bank assesses its intangible assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis. When impairment indicators are present, the r ecoverable amount of the asset, which is the higher of its estimated fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use, is determined. If the carrying amount of the asset is higher than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down to its recoverable amount. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Bank estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. If the CGU is not impaired, the useful life of the intangible asset is assessed with any changes applied on a prospective basis.

Changes in their fair value are recorded in trading income or loss.\n\n2. **Servicing Rights**: When the bank retains servicing rights, it assesses the benefits against market expectations. A servicing asset or liability is recognized based on whether the benefits are more or less than adequate, respectively.\n\n3. **Financial Liabilities**: A financial liability is derecognized when discharged, canceled, or expired. If replaced or modified substantially, the original liability is derecognized, and a new one is recognized.\n\n4. **Securities Transactions**: The bank engages in reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements, treating them as collateralized lending and borrowing transactions, respectively. These are recorded at amortized cost unless held-for-trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\n\n5. **Securities Lending and Borrowing**: In securities lending, the bank receives collateral and records cash collateral as an obligation. In borrowing, it pledges collateral, recording cash transactions as reverse repurchase agreements.\n\n6. **Goodwill and Intangible Assets**: Goodwill is monitored at the cash-generating unit (CGU) level and assessed for impairment annually. Intangible assets, including software, are amortized over their useful lives and assessed for impairment quarterly.\n\nOverall, the text details the bank's approach to valuing and reporting various financial instruments and assets, emphasizing fair value assessments, impairment testing, and the treatment of securities transactions."

Reversal of any impairment loss will not exceed the carrying amount of the intangible asset that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior periods. LAND, BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER Land is recognized at cost. Buildings, computer equipment, furniture and fixtures, other equipment, and leasehold impr ovements are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if any. Gains or losses on disposal are included in Non-interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Bank records the obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and can be r easonably estimated, and records a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the asset. The asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its remaining useful life while the liability is accreted to reflect the passage of time until the eventual settlement of the obligation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets estimated by asset category, as follows: Asset Useful Life Buildings 15 to 40 years Computer equipment 2 to 8 years Furniture and fixtures 3 to 15 years Other equipment 5 to 15 years Leasehold improvements Lesser of the remaining lease term and the remaining useful life of the asset The Bank assesses its depreciable assets for changes in useful life or impairment on a quarterly basis. Where an impairment indicator exists and the depreciable asset does not generate separate cash flows on a stand-alone basis, impairment is assessed based on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the depreciable asset belongs. If the CGU is not impaired, the useful life of the depreciable asset is assessed with any changes applied on a prospective basis. Any impairment loss is recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period in which the impairment is identified. Impairment losses previously recognized are assessed and reversed if the circumstances leading to their impairment are no longer present. Reversal of any impairment loss will not exceed the carrying amount of the depreciable asset that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior periods. NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE Individual non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held- for-sale if they ar e available for immediate sale in their present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets or disposal groups, and their sale must be highly probable to occur within one year. For a sale to be highly probable, management must be committed to a sales plan and initiate an active program to market the sale of the non-current assets or disposal groups. Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Write-downs on premises related non-current assets and write-downs on equipment on initial classification as held-for-sale are included in Non-interest expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Subsequently, a non-current asset or disposal group that is held-for-sale is no longer depreciated or amortized, and any subsequent write-downs in fair value less costs to sell or such increases not in excess of cumulative write-downs, are recognized in Other income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The Bank grants share options to certain employees as compensation for services provided to the Bank. The Bank uses a binomial tr ee-based valuation option pricing model to estimate fair value for all share option compensation awards. The cost of the share options is based on the fair value estimated at the grant date and is recognized as compensation expense and contributed surplus over the service period required for employees to become fully entitled to the awards. This period is generally equal to the vesting period in addition to a period prior to the grant date. For the Bank’s share options, this period is generally equal to five years. When options are exer cised, the amount initially recognized in the contributed surplus balance is reduced, with a corresponding increase in common shares. The Bank has various other share-based compensation plans where certain employees are awar ded share units equivalent to the Bank’s common shares as compensation for services provided to the Bank. The obligation related to share units is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the share units at the grant date adjusted for changes in fair value between the grant date and the vesting date, net of hedging activities, over the service period required for employees to become fully entitled to the awards. This period is generally equal to the vesting period, in addition to a period prior to the grant date. For the Bank’s share units, this period is generally equal to four years. Defined Benefit Plans Actuarial valuations are prepared at least every three years to determine the present value of the pr ojected benefit obligation related to the Bank’s defined benefit plans. In periods between actuarial valuations, an extrapolation is performed based on the most recent valuation completed. All remeasurement gains and losses are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income, with cumulative gains and losses reclassified to retained earnings. Pension and post-retirement defined benefit plan expenses are determined based upon separate actuarial valuations using the projected benefit method pro-rated on service and management’s best estimates of discount rate, compensation increases, health care cost trend rate, and mortality rates, which are reviewed annually with the Bank’s actuaries. The discount rate used to value liabilities is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the plans’ specific cash flows. The expense recognized includes the cost of benefits for employee service provided in the current year, net interest expense or income on the net defined benefit liability or asset, past service costs related to plan amendments, curtailments or settlements, and administrative costs. Plan amendment costs are recognized in the period of a plan amendment, irrespective of its vested status. Curtailments and settlements are recognized by the Bank when the curtailment or settlement occurs. A curtailment occurs when there is a significant reduction in the number of employees covered by the plan. A settlement occurs when the Bank enters into a transaction that eliminates all further legal or constructive obligation for part or all of the benefits provided under a defined benefit plan. The fair value of plan assets and the present value of the projected benefit obligation are measur ed as at October 31. The net defined benefit asset or liability represents the difference between the cumulative remeasurement gains and losses, expenses, and recognized contributions and is reported in other assets or other liabilities. Net defined benefit assets recognized by the Bank are subject to a ceiling which limits the asset recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet to the amount that is r ecoverable through refunds of contributions or future contribution holidays. In addition, where a regulatory funding deficit exists related to a defined benefit plan, the Bank is required to record a liability equal to the present value of all future cash payments required to eliminate that deficit. Defined Contribution Plans For defined contribution plans, annual pension expense is equal to the Bank’s contributions to those plans. Pr emiums for short-duration insurance contracts are deferred as unearned premiums and r eported in Non-interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the underlying policies, usually twelve months. Such premiums are recognized net of amounts ceded for reinsurance and apply primarily to property and casualty contracts. Unearned premiums are reported in insurance-related liabilities, gross of premiums ceded to reinsurers which are recognized in other assets. Premiums from life and health insurance policies are recognized as income when earned in insurance revenue. For property and casualty insurance, insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities repr esent current claims and estimates for future claims related to insurable events occurring at or before the Consolidated Balance Sheet 152 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",

Key insights include:\n\n1. **Impairment and Depreciation**: Impairment losses are recognized and potentially reversed if conditions improve, but reversals cannot exceed the original carrying amount. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over specified useful lives for different asset categories.\n\n2. **Non-Current Assets Held-for-Sale**: These assets are classified as such if a sale is highly probable within a year. They are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, and are not depreciated once classified as held-for-sale.\n\n3. **Share-Based Compensation**: The bank uses a binomial tree-based model to value share options, recognizing compensation expenses over the vesting period. Share units are also awarded, with expenses adjusted for fair value changes.\n\n4. **Defined Benefit Plans**: Actuarial valuations determine the present value of obligations, with remeasurement gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income. Expenses include current service costs, interest, and plan amendments.\n\n5. **Defined Contribution Plans**: Expenses are based on the bank's contributions. Insurance premiums are deferred and recognized over the policy term, with specific accounting for reinsurance and claims.\n\nOverall, the text details the bank's approach to managing and reporting various financial elements, ensuring compliance with accounting standards and reflecting accurate financial positions."

Expected claims and policy benefit liabilities are determined on a case-by-case basis and consider such variables as past loss experience, current claims trends and changes in the prevailing social, economic, and legal environment. These liabilities are continually reviewed, and as experience develops and new information becomes known, the liabilities are adjusted as necessary. In addition to reported claims information, the liabilities recognized by the Bank include a provision to account for the future development of insurance claims, including insurance claims incurred but not reported by policyholders (IBNR). IBNR liabilities are evaluated based on historical development trends and actuarial methodologies for groups of claims with similar attributes. For life and health insurance, actuarial liabilities represent the present values of future policy cash flows as determined using standard actuarial valuation practices. Actuarial liabilities are reported in insurance-related liabilities with changes reported in insurance claims and related expenses. Provisions are recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, the amount of which can be reliably estimated, and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured based on management’s best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation, using a discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. Income tax is comprised of current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognized in the Provision for (recovery of) income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related taxes are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the amounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the tax rates that are expected to apply when the assets or liabilities are reported for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against which deductible temporary differences may be utilized. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, branches, and associates, and interests in joint ventures if the Bank controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Bank records a provision for uncertain tax positions if it is probable that the Bank will have to make a payment to tax authorities upon their examination of a tax position. This provision is measured at the Bank’s best estimate of the amount expected to be paid. Provisions are reversed in provision for (recovery of) income taxes in the period in which management determines they are no longer required or as determined by statute. An arrangement contains a lease if there is an identified asset and the Bank has a right to control that asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability is recognized for all leases except for short-term leases and low value leases, as described below. At the lease commencement date, the lease liability is initially recognized at the present value of the future lease payments over the remaining lease term and is discounted using the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate. The ROU asset is recognized at cost, comprising an amount equal to the lease liability, subject to certain adjustments. Subsequently, the ROU asset is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities, while the lease liability is accreted using the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is remeasured when there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or changes in the Bank’s assumptions or strategies relating to the exercise of purchase, extension, or termination options. The Bank’s leases consist primarily of real estate, equipment and other asset leases. ROU assets are recorded in Land, buildings, equipment, other depreciable assets, and right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Interest expense on lease liabilities is included in Net interest income and depreciation expense on the ROU assets is recognized in Non-interest expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less, and leases of low-value assets are exempt, and their payments are recognized in Non-interest expenses on a straight-line basis within the Bank’s Consolidated Statement of Income. NOTE 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS | The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Business Model Assessment The Bank determines its business models based on the objective under which its portfolios of financial assets are managed. Refer to Note 2 for details on the Bank’s business models. In determining its business models, the Bank considers the following: • Management’s intent and strategic objectives and the operation of the stated policies in practice; • The primary risks that affect the performance of the portfolio of assets and how these risks are managed; • How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to management; and • The frequency and significance of financial asset sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and the expected future sales activities. Sales in themselves do not determine the business model and are not considered in isolation. Instead, sales provide evidence about how cash flows are realized. A held-to-collect business model will be reassessed by the Bank to determine whether any sales are consistent with an objective of collecting contractual cash flows if the sales are more than insignificant in value or more than infrequent. Solely Payments of Principal and Interest Test In assessing whether contractual cash flows represent SPPI, the Bank considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS 153",

Key insights include:\n\n1. **Actuarial Liabilities**: These are determined using accepted actuarial practices, considering past loss experience, current trends, and changes in the environment. They include provisions for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR).\n\n2. **Provisions**: Recognized when there is a probable obligation from a past event, measured at the best estimate of the settlement amount, considering risks and uncertainties. If significant, they are discounted to present value.\n\n3. **Income Tax**: Comprises current and deferred tax, with deferred tax recognized on temporary differences between book and tax values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognized when future taxable profits are probable.\n\n4. **Leases**: Right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized for most leases, except short-term and low-value leases. Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of future payments, and ROU assets are adjusted for depreciation and impairment.\n\n5. **Accounting Judgments and Estimates**: The bank uses complex judgments and estimates in its accounting policies, which are crucial for understanding its financial condition. Changes in these can significantly impact financial statements.\n\n6. **Business Model Assessment**: The bank assesses its business models based on management's intent, risk management, performance evaluation, and sales activities, ensuring alignment with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows.\n\n7. **SPPI Test**: The bank evaluates whether contractual cash flows of financial instruments represent solely payments of principal and interest, considering the terms of the instrument.\n\nOverall, the text emphasizes the importance of systematic and controlled processes in applying accounting policies and adapting to changes in standards and methodologies."

        "chunk": "whether the financial asset contains contractual terms that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that they would not be consistent with a basic lending arrangement. In making the assessment, the Bank considers the primary terms as follows and assesses if the contractual cash flows of the instrument continue to meet the SPPI test: • Performance-linked features; • Terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (non-recourse terms); • Prepayment and extension terms; • Leverage features; • Features that modify elements of the time value of money; and • Sustainability-linked features. Significant Increase in Credit Risk For retail exposures, criteria for assessing significant increase in credit risk ar e defined at the appropriate product or portfolio level and vary based on the exposure’s credit risk at origination. The criteria include relative changes in PD, absolute PD backstop, and delinquency backstop when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition has occurred when one of the criteria is met. For non-retail exposures, BRR is determined on an individual borrower basis using industry and sector specific cr edit risk models that are based on historical data. Current and forward-looking information that is specific to the borrower, industry, and sector is considered based on expert credit judgment. Criteria for assessing significant increase in credit risk are defined at the appropriate segmentation level and vary based on the BRR of the exposure at origination. Criteria include relative changes in BRR, absolute BRR backstop, and delinquency backstop when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition has occurred when one of the criteria is met. Measurement of Expected Credit Loss ECLs are recognized on the initial recognition of financial assets. Allowance for cr edit losses represents management’s unbiased estimate of the risk of default and ECLs on the financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. For retail exposures, ECLs are calculated as the product of PD, loss given default (LGD), and exposur e at default (EAD) at each time step over the remaining expected life of the financial asset and discounted to the reporting date based on the EIR. PD estimates represent the forward-looking PD, updated quarterly based on the Bank’s historical experience, current conditions, and relevant forward-looking expectations over the expected life of the exposure to determine the lifetime PD curve. LGD estimates are determined based on historical charge-off events and recovery payments, current information about attributes specific to the borrower, and direct costs. Expected cash flows from collateral, guarantees, and other credit enhancements are incorporated in LGD if integral to the contractual terms. Relevant macroeconomic variables are incorporated in determining expected LGD. EAD represents the expected balance at default across the remaining expected life of the exposure. EAD incorporates forward-looking expectations about repayments of drawn balances and future draws where applicable. For non-retail exposures, ECLs are calculated based on the present value of cash shortfalls determined as the dif ference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. Lifetime PD is determined by mapping the exposure’s BRR to forward-looking PD over the expected life. LGD estimates are determined by mapping the exposure’s facility risk rating (FRR) to expected LGD which takes into account facility-specific characteristics such as collateral, seniority ranking of debt, and loan structure. Relevant macroeconomic variables are incorporated in determining expected PD and LGD. Expected cash flows are determined by applying the PD and LGD estimates to the contractual cash flows to calculate cash shortfalls over the expected life of the exposure. Forward-Looking Information In calculating ECLs, the Bank employs internally developed models that utilize parameters for PD, LGD, and EAD. Forwar d-looking macroeconomic factors including at the regional level are incorporated in the risk parameters as relevant. Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. Forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts are generated by TD Economics as part of the ECL process: A base economic forecast is accompanied with upside and downside estimates of realistically possible economic conditions by considering the sources of uncertainty around the base forecast. All macroeconomic forecasts are updated quarterly for each variable on a regional basis where applicable and incorporated as relevant into the quarterly modelling of base, upside and downside risk parameters used in the calculation of ECL scenarios and probability-weighted ECLs. TD Economics will apply judgment to recommend probability weights to each forecast on a quarterly basis. The proposed macroeconomic forecasts and probability weightings are subject to robust management review and challenge process by a cross-functional committee that includes representation from TD Economics, Risk, Finance, and Business. ECLs calculated under each of the three forecasts are applied against the respective probability weightings to determine the probability-weighted ECLs. Refer to Note 8 for further details on the macroeconomic variables and ECL sensitivity. Expert Credit Judgment Management’s expert credit judgment is used to determine the best estimate for the qualitative component contributing to ECLs, based on an assessment of business and economic conditions, historical loss experience, loan portfolio composition, and other r elevant indicators and forward-looking information that are not fully incorporated into the model calculation. There remains elevated economic uncertainty, and management continues to exer cise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. The Bank applies judgment in determining the appropriate lease term on a lease-by-lease basis. All facts and cir cumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal option or not to exercise a termination option including investments in major leaseholds, branch performance and past business practice are considered. The periods covered by renewal or termination options are only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the Bank will exercise the options; management considers “reasonably certain” to be a high threshold. Changes in the economic environment or changes in the industry may impact the Bank’s assessment of lease term, and any changes in the Bank’s estimate of lease terms may have a material impact on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income. In determining the carrying amount of ROU assets and lease liabilities, the Bank is r equired to estimate the incremental borrowing rate specific to each leased asset or portfolio of leased assets if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The Bank determines the incremental borrowing rate of each leased asset or portfolio of leased assets by incorporating the Bank’s creditworthiness, the security, term, and value of the ROU asset, and the economic environment in which the leased asset operates. The incremental borrowing rates are subject to change mainly due to changes in the macroeconomic environment. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets at the balance sheet date is based on their quoted market prices. For all other financial instruments not traded in an active market, fair value may be based on other observable curr ent market transactions involving the same 154 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",

Observable market inputs may include interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and option volatilities. Valuation techniques include comparisons with similar instruments where observable market prices exist, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. For certain complex or illiquid financial instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques in which curr ent market transactions or observable market inputs are not available. Judgment is used when determining which valuation techniques to apply, liquidity considerations, and model inputs such as volatilities, correlations, spreads, discount rates, pre-payment rates, and prices of underlying instruments. Any imprecision in these estimates can affect the resulting fair value. Judgment is also used in recording valuation adjustments to model fair values to account for system limitations or measur ement uncertainty, such as when valuing complex and less actively traded financial instruments. If the market for a complex financial instrument develops, the pricing for this instrument may become more transparent, resulting in refinement of valuation models. For example, Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) cessation may also have an impact on the fair value of products that reference or use valuation models with CDOR inputs. An analysis of the fair value of financial instruments and further details as to how they ar e measured are provided in Note 5. Certain financial assets transferred may qualify for derecognition from the Bank’ s Consolidated Balance Sheet. To qualify for derecognition, certain key determinations must be made, including whether the Bank’s rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have been retained or transferred and the extent to which the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets have been retained or transferred. If the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, a decision must be made as to whether the Bank has retained control of the financial asset. Upon derecognition, the Bank will record a gain or loss on sale of those assets which is calculated as the dif ference between the carrying amount of the asset transferred and the sum of any cash proceeds received, including any financial assets received or financial liabilities assumed, and any cumulative gains or losses allocated to the transferred asset that had been recognized in AOCI. In determining the fair value of any financial assets received, the Bank estimates future cash flows by relying on estimates of the amount of interest that will be collected on the securitized assets, the yield to be paid to investors, the portion of the securitized assets that will be prepaid before their scheduled maturity, ECLs, the cost of servicing the assets, and the rate at which to discount these expected future cash flows. Actual cash flows may differ significantly from those estimated by the Bank. Retained interests are financial interests in transferred assets retained by the Bank. They ar e classified as trading securities and are initially recognized at relative fair value on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequently, the fair value of retained interests is determined by estimating the present value of future expected cash flows. Differences between the actual cash flows and the Bank’s estimated future cash flows are recognized in trading income (loss). These assumptions are subject to periodic reviews and may change due to significant changes in the economic environment. The recoverable amount of the Bank’s CGUs is determined from internally developed valuation models that consider various factors and assumptions such as for ecasted earnings, growth rates, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. Management is required to use judgment in estimating the recoverable amount of CGUs, and the use of different assumptions and estimates in the calculations could influence the determination of the existence of impairment and the valuation of goodwill. Management believes that the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and supportable. Where possible, assumptions generated internally are compar ed to relevant market information. The carrying amounts of the Bank’s CGUs are determined by management using risk-based capital models to adjust net assets and liabilities by CGU. These models consider various factors including market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, including investment capital (comprised of goodwill and other intangibles). Any capital not directly attributable to the CGUs is held within the Corporate segment. The Bank’s capital oversight committees provide oversight to the Bank’s capital allocation methodologies. The projected benefit obligation and expense related to the Bank’s pension and post-r etirement defined benefit plans are determined using multiple assumptions that may significantly influence the value of these amounts. Actuarial assumptions including discount rates, compensation increases, health care cost trend rates, and mortality rates are management’s best estimates and are reviewed annually with the Bank’s actuaries. The Bank develops each assumption using relevant historical experience of the Bank in conjunction with market-related data and considers if the market- related data indicates there is any prolonged or significant impact on the assumptions. The discount rate used to value the projected benefit obligation is determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the plans’ specific cash flows. The other assumptions are also long-term estimates. All assumptions are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Differences between actual experiences and the assumptions, as well as changes in the assumptions resulting from changes in future expectations, result in remeasurement gains and losses which are recognized in OCI during the year and also impact expenses in future periods. The Bank is subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations in the or dinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Bank maintains provisions for uncertain tax positions that it believes appropriately reflect the risk of tax positions under discussion, audit, dispute, or appeal with tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty. These provisions are made using the Bank’s best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on an assessment of all relevant factors, which are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. However, it is possible that at some future date, changes in these liabilities could result from audits by the relevant taxing authorities. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that suf ficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against which deductible temporary differences may be utilized. The amount of the deferred tax asset recognized and considered realizable could, however, be reduced if projected income is not achieved due to various factors, such as unfavourable business conditions. If projected income is not expected to be achieved, the Bank would decrease its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes can be realized. The magnitude of the decrease is significantly influenced by the Bank’s forecast of future profit generation, which determines the extent to which it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets. Provisions arise when there is some uncertainty in the timing or amount of a loss in the futur e. Provisions are based on the Bank’s best estimate of all expenditures required to settle its present obligations, considering all relevant risks and uncertainties, as well as, when material, the effect of the time value of money. Many of the Bank’s provisions relate to various legal actions that the Bank is involved in during the or dinary course of business. Legal provisions require the involvement of both the Bank’s management and legal counsel when assessing the probability of a loss and estimating any monetary impact. Throughout the life of a provision, the Bank’s management or legal counsel may learn of additional information that may impact its assessments about the probability of loss or about the TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS 155",

For complex or illiquid instruments, judgment is required to select appropriate models and inputs, which can affect fair value estimates.\n\n2. **Derecognition of Financial Assets**: The bank assesses whether financial assets can be removed from its balance sheet based on the transfer of risks and rewards. Gains or losses from derecognition are calculated based on the difference between the asset's carrying amount and proceeds received.\n\n3. **Retained Interests**: These are classified as trading securities and valued based on expected future cash flows. Differences between actual and estimated cash flows impact trading income.\n\n4. **Valuation of CGUs**: The bank uses internally developed models to estimate the recoverable amount of Cash Generating Units (CGUs), considering factors like forecasted earnings and discount rates. Assumptions are compared to market data where possible.\n\n5. **Pension and Post-Retirement Plans**: The bank uses actuarial assumptions to determine obligations and expenses, which are reviewed annually. Changes in assumptions can lead to remeasurement gains or losses.\n\n6. **Taxation and Deferred Tax Assets**: The bank maintains provisions for uncertain tax positions and recognizes deferred tax assets when future taxable profits are probable. Changes in business conditions can affect the realizability of these assets.\n\n7. **Provisions for Uncertainties**: Provisions are made for potential future losses, including legal actions, based on the bank's best estimates and involve management and legal counsel.\n\nOverall, the text highlights the complexity and judgment involved in financial reporting and valuation, emphasizing the impact of market conditions and assumptions on financial outcomes."

        "chunk": "estimates of amounts involved. Changes in these assessments may lead to changes in the amount recorded for provisions. In addition, the actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts recognized. The Bank reviews its legal provisions on a case- by-case basis after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Bank’s experience, the experience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Certain of the Bank’s provisions relate to restructuring initiatives initiated by the Bank. Restructuring pr ovisions require management’s best estimate, including forecasts of economic conditions. Throughout the life of a provision, the Bank may become aware of additional information that may impact the assessment of amounts to be incurred. Changes in these assessments may lead to changes in the amount recorded for restructuring provisions. The assumptions used in establishing the Bank’s insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities ar e based on best estimates of possible outcomes. For property and casualty insurance, the ultimate cost of claims liabilities is estimated using a range of standar d actuarial claims projection techniques in accordance with Canadian accepted actuarial practices. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in the future, in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate claims cost that present the most likely outcome taking into account all the uncertainties involved. For life and health insurance, actuarial liabilities consider all future policy cash flows, including pr emiums, claims, and expenses required to administer the policies. Critical assumptions used in the measurement of life and health insurance contract liabilities are determined by the appointed actuary. Further information on insurance risk assumptions is provided in Note 21. Management judgment is required when assessing whether the Bank should consolidate an entity . For instance, it may not be feasible to determine if the Bank controls an entity solely through an assessment of voting rights for certain structured entities. In these cases, judgment is required to establish whether the Bank has decision-making power over the key relevant activities of the entity and whether the Bank has the ability to use that power to absorb significant variable returns from the entity. If it is determined that the Bank has both decision-making power and significant variable returns from the entity, judgment is also used to determine whether any such power is exercised by the Bank as principal, on its own behalf, or as agent, on behalf of another counterparty. Assessing whether the Bank has decision-making power includes understanding the purpose and design of the entity in or der to determine its key economic activities. In this context, an entity’s key economic activities are those which predominantly impact the economic performance of the entity. When the Bank has the current ability to direct the entity’s key economic activities, it is considered to have decision-making power over the entity. The Bank also evaluates its exposure to the variable returns of a structur ed entity in order to determine if it absorbs a significant proportion of the variable returns the entity is designed to create. As part of this evaluation, the Bank considers the purpose and design of the entity in order to determine whether it absorbs variable returns from the structured entity through its contractual holdings, which may take the form of securities issued by the entity, derivatives with the entity, or other arrangements such as guarantees, liquidity facilities, or lending commitments. If the Bank has decision-making power over the entity and absorbs significant variable r eturns from the entity, it then determines if it is acting as principal or agent when exercising its decision-making power. Key factors considered include the scope of its decision-making power; the rights of other parties involved with the entity, including any rights to remove the Bank as decision-maker or rights to participate in key decisions; whether the rights of other parties ar e exercisable in practice; and the variable returns absorbed by the Bank and by other parties involved with the entity. When assessing consolidation, a presumption exists that the Bank exercises decision-making power as principal if it is also exposed to significant variable returns, unless an analysis of the factors above indicates otherwise. The decisions above are made with reference to the specific facts and cir cumstances relevant for the structured entity and related transaction(s) under consideration. The Bank applies judgment to determine the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations which af fects the timing of revenue recognition, by evaluating the pattern in which the Bank transfers control of services promised to the customer. A performance obligation is satisfied over time when the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the Bank performs the service. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is generally recognized using the time-elapsed method which is based on time elapsed in proportion to the period over which the service is provided, for example, personal deposit account bundle fees. The time-elapsed method is a faithful depiction of the transfer of control for these services as control is transferred evenly to the customer when the Bank provides a stand-ready service or effort is expended evenly by the Bank to provide a service over the contract period. In contracts where the Bank has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Bank’s performance completed to date, the Bank recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice. The Bank satisfies a performance obligation at a point in time if the customer obtains contr ol of the promised services at that date. Determining when control is transferred requires the use of judgment. For transaction-based services, the Bank determines that control is transferred to the customer at a point in time when the customer obtains substantially all of the benefits from the service rendered and the Bank has a present right to payment, which generally coincides with the moment the transaction is executed. The Bank exercises judgment in determining whether costs incurred in connection with acquiring new r evenue contracts would meet the requirement to be capitalized as incremental costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with customers. INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM PHASE 2 Effective November 1, 2020, the Bank early adopted the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 and no transitional adjustment was r equired. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 addresses issues affecting financial r eporting when changes are made to contractual cash flows of financial instruments or hedging relationships as a result of IBOR reform. The amendments permit modification to financial assets, financial liabilities and lessee lease liabilities required as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and made on an economically equivalent basis to be accounted for by updating the EIR prospectively. If the modification does not meet the practical expedient requirements, existing IFRS requirements are applied. Relief is also provided for an entity’s hedge accounting relationships in circumstances where changes to hedged items and hedging instruments arise as a result of IBOR reform. The amendments enable entities to amend the formal designation and documentation of a hedging relationship to reflect these changes without discontinuing the hedging relationship or designating a new hedging relationship. Permitted changes include redefining the hedged risk to reference an ARR (contractually or non- contractually specified), amending the description of the hedged item and hedging instrument to reflect the ARR, and amending the description of how the entity will assess hedge effectiveness. Hedging relationships within the scope of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 are the same as those within the scope of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 1. 156 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",
        "summary": "The text discusses several key financial considerations for a bank, including the management of legal and restructuring provisions, insurance claims, and policy benefit liabilities. It highlights the importance of judgment in assessing provisions, estimating costs, and determining control over entities for consolidation purposes. The bank uses actuarial techniques and qualitative judgment to estimate insurance liabilities and applies judgment in revenue recognition, particularly in determining when performance obligations are satisfied. Additionally, the text addresses the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2, which allows for modifications to financial instruments and hedging relationships due to IBOR reform without requiring transitional adjustments. This reform facilitates the updating of financial reporting to reflect changes in interest rate benchmarks while maintaining existing hedging relationships."

        "chunk": "Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 also amended IFRS 7, introducing expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the risks arising from IBOR reform, how an entity is managing those risks, its progress in completing the transition to ARRs, and how it is managing the transition. The global benchmark rate reform initiative to transition from IBOR benchmarks (such as CDOR to ARRs) may result in market dislocation and have other adverse consequences to the Bank, its customers, market participants, and the financial services industry. Market risks arise because the new reference rates are likely to differ from the prior benchmark rates resulting in differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions, require alternative hedging strategies, or affect the Bank’s capital and liquidity planning and management. In Canada specifically, the expected discontinuation of the Bankers’ Acceptance (BA) lending model, which is responsible for creating the BA investment securities that are sold to money market investors, might also have impacts to the Bank’s investment portfolio holdings and impact related earnings. In order to manage these risks, the Bank has established an enterprise-wide, cross functional initiative with senior executive oversight to evaluate and monitor the impact of the market, financial, operational, legal, technology and other risks on its products, services, systems, models, documents, processes, and risk management frameworks with the intention of managing the impact through appropriate mitigating actions, but such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate against the impact of all such risks. Following previous announcements by various regulators, the publication has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and euro London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings, as well as the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings effective December 31, 2021. From June 30, 2023, all remaining USD LIBOR tenors have either ceased or are published only on a synthetic basis for the use in legacy contracts that have no other fallback solution. Six-month and twelve-month CDOR tenors ceased to be published effective May 17, 2021, while the remaining tenors of CDOR (one-month, two-month, and three-month) will cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. In July 2023, the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate working group introduced a “no new CDOR or Banker’s Acceptance loan” milestone date of November 1, 2023 to facilitate a tapered transition for the loan market by reducing the volume of loans that need to be remediated ahead of CDOR’s cessation. The Bank has incorporated these developments into its benchmark rate reform plan. To ensure an orderly transition, the Bank continues to monitor developments and incorporate global working groups’ and regulators’ best practice guidance on transition activities. These activities include, but are not limited to, making available new products referencing ARRs, preparing to cease the issuance of the residual CDOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy contracts by incorporating appropriate fallback language and preparing for overall operational readiness. The Bank continues to make progress on its CDOR transition plan. The Bank’s exposure to non-derivative financial assets, non-derivative financial liabilities, derivative notional amounts and off-balance sheet commitments referencing USD LIBOR is no longer material to its financial statements as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $89 billion, $604 million, $4,387 billion and $71 billion, respectively). The following table discloses the Bank’s exposure to financial instruments referencing CDOR that have yet to transition to an ARR and mature after June 28, 2024. Exposures to CDOR Subject to Reform1,2 (millions of Canadian dollars) As at October 31 2023 October 31 2022 Non-derivative financial assets3 $ 17,236 $ 10,927 Non-derivative financial liabilities4 11,892 12,689 Derivative notional amounts 2,644,854 3,066,690 Off-balance sheet commitments5 63,628 48,838 1 CDOR includes exposure to one-month, two-month, and three-month tenors for CDOR and BA rates. 2 Certain demand deposits with no specific maturity allow the Bank to change the benchmark reference rate at its sole discretion and are therefore excluded from the table. As at October 31, 2023, the carrying amount of demand deposits with no specific maturity was $7 billion (October 31, 2022 – $8 billion). 3 Loans reported under non-derivative financial assets represent the drawn amounts and exclude allowance for loan losses. As at October 31, 2023, non-derivative financial assets were $17 billion, of which $9 billion relates to Loans and $6 billion relates to Debt securities at amortized cost. As at October 31, 2022, non-derivative financial assets were $11 billion, of which $3 billion relates to Loans and $5 billion relates to Debt securities at amortized cost. 4 As at October 31, 2023, non-derivative financial liabilities were $12 billion, of which $7 billion relates to Subordinated notes and debentures. As at October 31, 2022, non-derivative financial liabilities were $13 billion, of which $9 billion relates to Subordinated notes and debentures. 5 Exposures reflect authorized and committed undrawn commitments. For multi- currency facilities, the currency of borrowing is often the same as the facility currency and therefore the Bank has assumed that the benchmark interest rate for its undrawn credit and liquidity commitments is in the same facility currency as the benchmark rate for that currency for the purpose of this disclosure. Off-balance sheet commitments include drawn amounts of BA borrowings. NOTE 4 CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES | The following amendments to an accounting standard have been adopted by the Bank for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2023. Amendments to IAS 12 – Income Taxes On May 23, 2023, the IASB issued International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules, which amends IAS 12, Income Taxes. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from the requirements to recognize and disclose information about deferred taxes related to the implementation of Pillar Two model rules. The Bank has applied the temporary mandatory exception in jurisdictions in which the rules have been substantively enacted, which is effective immediately and is retrospective. The Bank has assessed that the retrospective application has no current impact on the Bank’s consolidated results as at October 31, 2023. Effective for reporting periods beginning on or after November 1, 2023, additional disclosure of current tax expense (recovery) and other information related to Pillar Two income tax exposures are required. The following standard has been issued but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4), and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023, for the Bank. OSFI’s related Advisory precludes early adoption. The Bank will apply the standard retrospectively with restatement of comparatives, where it will recognize the cumulative effect of adopting the standard as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance as of November 1, 2022.

        "chunk": "The Bank will transition to IFRS 17 by primarily applying the full retrospective approach. This approach results in the measurement of insurance contracts as if IFRS 17 had always applied to them. Under IFRS 17, the measurement of insurance contracts includes a risk adjustment, which represents the compensation the Bank requires for bearing the uncertainty related to non-financial risk in its fulfilment of insurance contracts. The risk adjustment replaces the provision for adverse deviation under IFRS 4 and is expected to result in a lower valuation of insurance liabilities. When onerous contract groups are identified, the expected losses related to those contract groups shall be recorded in income. This results in an earlier recognition of losses compared to IFRS 4. The Bank estimates a decrease to insurance-related liabilities and an increase to retained earnings of approximately $0.1 billion after-tax at November 1, 2022. | IFRS 17 requires cash flows to be measured at their present value using a discount factor that is reflective of the characteristics of the liability, the discount factor is no longer tied to the yield of the securities supporting insurance reserves. In adopting IFRS 17, the Bank will apply transitional guidance to reclassify certain securities supporting insurance reserves from financial assets designated at FVTPL to FVOCI and vice versa to minimize accounting mismatches arising from the application of the new discount factor under IFRS 17. The reclassification will be retrospectively applied on November 1, 2023 and will result in the movement of cumulative unrealized losses between accumulated other comprehensive income and retained earnings. The Bank’s adoption of IFRS 17 is supported by a robust governance structure. The Executive Steering Committee includes representation from the Insurance business, Finance, Actuaries, Risk, Technology, and project management teams. Updates are also provided to the TD insurance subsidiary boards, Risk Committee, and Audit Committee of the Bank. NOTE 5 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Certain assets and liabilities, primarily financial instruments, are carried on the balance sheet at their fair value on a recurring basis. These financial instruments include trading loans and securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL, financial assets and liabilities designated at FVTPL, financial assets at FVOCI, derivatives, certain securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, trading deposits, securitization liabilities at fair value, obligations related to securities sold short, and certain obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are carried at amortized cost. (a) VALUATION GOVERNANCE Valuation processes are guided by policies and procedures that are approved by senior management and subject matter experts. Senior Executive oversight over the valuation process is provided through various valuation committees. Further, the Bank has a number of additional controls in place, including an independent price verification process to ensure the accuracy of fair value measurements reported in the financial statements. The sources used for independent pricing comply with the standards set out in the approved valuation-related policies, which include consideration of the reliability, relevancy, and timeliness of data. (b) METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS The Bank calculates fair value for measurement and disclosure purposes based on the following methods of valuation and assumptions: Government and Government-Related Securities The fair value of Canadian government debt securities is determined by quoted prices in active markets, reference to recent transaction prices, or third-party vendor prices. In cases where external and independent prices are not readily available, alternate techniques utilizing the risk metrics and unique characteristics of the security are used to support a prudent valuation until acceptable external pricing becomes available. The fair value of Canadian residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS) is based on third-party vendor prices, reference to recent transaction prices, or valuation techniques that utilize observable inputs such as benchmark government bond prices, government bond yield curves, quoted yield spreads and prepayment rate assumptions related to the underlying collateral. The fair value of U.S. government and agency debt securities is determined by reference to recent transaction prices, broker quotes, or third-party vendor prices. For U.S. agency MBS pricing, brokers or third- party vendors may use a pool-specific valuation model to value these securities, using observable market inputs. The fair value of other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) government-guaranteed debt is based on broker quotes and third-party vendor prices, or where external and independent prices are not readily available, alternate techniques based on the risk metrics and unique characteristics of the security are used to support a prudent valuation until acceptable external pricing becomes available. Other Debt Securities The fair value of corporate and other debt securities is based on broker quotes, third-party vendor prices, or alternate techniques utilizing the risk metrics and unique characteristics of the security used to support a prudent valuation until acceptable external pricing becomes available. Asset-backed securities are primarily fair valued using third-party vendor prices, including those generated by issue-specific valuation models using observable market inputs. Equity Securities The fair value of equity securities is based on quoted prices in active markets, where available. Where quoted prices in active markets are not readily available, such as for private equity securities, or where there is a wide bid-ask spread, fair value is determined based on quoted market prices for similar securities or through valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, multiples of earnings before taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other relevant valuation techniques. If there are trading restrictions on the equity security held, a valuation adjustment is recognized against available prices to reflect the nature of the restriction. However, restrictions that are not part of the security held and represent a separate contractual arrangement that has been entered into by the Bank and a third party do not impact the fair value of the original instrument. Retained Interests Retained interests are classified as trading securities and are initially recognized at their relative fair market value. Subsequently, the fair value of retained interests recognized by the Bank is determined by estimating the present value of future expected cash flows. Differences between the actual cash flows and the Bank’s estimate of future cash flows are recognized in income. These assumptions are subject to periodic review and may change due to significant changes in the economic environment. Loans The estimated fair value of loans carried at amortized cost reflects changes in market price that have occurred since the loans were originated or purchased. For fixed-rate performing loans, estimated fair value is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows related to these loans at current market interest rates for loans with similar credit risks. For floating-rate performing loans, changes in interest rates have minimal impact on fair value since loans reprice to market frequently. On that basis, fair value is assumed to approximate carrying value. The fair value of loans is not adjusted for the value of any credit protection the Bank has purchased to mitigate credit risk. 158 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",

        "chunk": "The fair value of loans carried at FVTPL, which includes trading loans and non-trading loans at FVTPL, is determined using observable market prices, where available. Where the Bank is a market maker for loans traded in the secondary market, fair value is determined using executed prices, or prices for comparable trades. For those loans where the Bank is not a market maker, the Bank obtains broker quotes from other reputable dealers, or uses valuation techniques to determine fair value. The fair value of loans carried at FVOCI is assumed to approximate amortized cost as they are generally floating rate performing loans that are short term in natur e. Commodities The fair value of commodities is based on quoted prices in active markets, where available. The Bank also transacts commodity derivative contracts which can be traded on an exchange or in OTC markets. Derivative Financial Instruments The fair value of exchange-traded derivative financial instruments is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of OTC derivative financial instruments is estimated using well established valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow techniques, the Black-Scholes model, and Monte Carlo simulation. The valuation models incorporate inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Prices derived by using models ar e recognized net of valuation adjustments. The inputs used in the valuation models depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instrument and are specific to the instrument being valued. Inputs can include, but ar e not limited to, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, dividend yield projections, commodity spot and forward prices, recovery rates, volatilities, spot prices, and correlation. A credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is recognized against the model value of OTC derivatives to account for the uncertainty that the counterparty in a derivative transaction may not be able to fulfil its obligations under the transaction to the Bank. In determining CVA, the Bank takes into account master netting agreements and collateral, and considers the creditworthiness of the counterparty, using market observed or proxy credit spreads, in assessing potential future amounts owed to the Bank. The fair value of a derivative is partly a function of collateralization. The Bank uses the relevant overnight index swap curve to discount the cash flows for collateralized derivatives as most collateral is posted in cash and can be funded at the over night rate. A funding valuation adjustment (FVA) is recognized against the model value of OTC derivatives to recognize the market implied unsecured funding costs and benefits consider ed in the pricing and fair value determination. Some of the key drivers of FVA include the market implied funding spread and the expected average exposure by counterparty. The Bank will continue to monitor industry practice on valuation adjustments and may refine the methodology as market practices evolve. Deposits The estimated fair value of term deposits is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows using interest rates currently of fered for deposits with similar terms. For deposits with no defined maturities, the Bank considers fair value to equal carrying value, which is equivalent to the amount payable on the balance sheet date. For trading deposits and deposits designated at FVTPL, which is included in financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, fair value is determined using discounted cash flow valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market inputs such as benchmark yield curves and foreign exchange rates. The Bank considers the impact of its own creditworthiness in the valuation of these deposits by reference to observable market inputs. Securitization Liabilities The fair value of securitization liabilities is based on quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar financial instruments, where available. Where quoted prices ar e not available, fair value is determined using valuation techniques, which maximize the use of observable inputs, such as Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) curves and MBS curves. Obligations Related to Securities Sold Short The fair value of these obligations is based on the fair value of the underlying securities, which can include equity or debt securities. As these obligations are fully collateralized, the method used to determine fair value would be the same as that of the relevant underlying equity or debt securities. Securities Purchased Under Reverse Repurchase Agreements and Obligations Related to Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements Commodities and certain bonds and equities pur chased or sold with an agreement to sell or repur chase them at a later date at a fixed price are carried at fair value. The fair value of these agreements is based on valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models which maximize the use of observable market inputs such as interest rate swap curves and commodity forward prices. Subordinated Notes and Debentures The fair value of subordinated notes and debentures are based on quoted market prices. Portfolio Exception IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement provides a measurement exception that allows an entity to determine the fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities with offsetting risks based on the sale or transfer of its net exposur e to a particular risk or risks. The Bank manages certain financial assets and financial liabilities, such as derivative assets and derivative liabilities, on the basis of net exposure to a particular risk, or risks; and uses mid-market prices as a basis for establishing fair values for the offsetting risk positions and applies the most representative price within the bid-ask spread to the net open position, as appropriate. Refer to Note 2 for further details on the use of the portfolio exception to establish fair value. (c) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value are disclosed in the table below. For these instruments, fair values ar e calculated for disclosure purposes only, using the valuation techniques used by the Bank. In addition, the Bank has determined that the carrying value of certain financial assets and liabilities approximates their fair value, which include: cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks, customers’ liability under acceptances, amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, other assets, acceptances, amounts payable to brokers, dealers, and clients, and other liabilities. Substantially all securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements are measured at amortized cost where the carrying value approximates their fair value.

Credit and funding valuation adjustments are applied to account for counterparty risk and funding costs. Deposits are valued using discounted cash flow techniques, considering the bank's creditworthiness. Securitization liabilities and obligations related to securities sold short are valued using market prices or valuation techniques with observable inputs.

(d) FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IFRS requires disclosure of a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The thr ee levels are defined as follows: Level 1: Fair value is based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities that are traded in an active exchange market or highly liquid and actively traded in OTC markets. Level 2: Fair value is based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted market prices for similar (but not identical) assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that ar e not active, and other inputs that are observable or can be corr oborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using valuation techniques with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3: Fair value is based on non-observable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Financial instruments classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy ar e initially recognized at their transaction price, which is considered the best estimate of fair value. After initial measurement, the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities is determined using valuation models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques.

(e) TRANSFERS BETWEEN FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY LEVELS The Bank’s policy is to record transfers of assets and liabilities between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy using the fair values as at the end of each reporting period. Assets are transferred between Level 1 and Level 2 depending on whether there is sufficient frequency and volume in an active market. During the year ended October 31, 2023, there wer e no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. During the year ended October 31, 2022, the Bank transferred $383 million of FVOCI U.S. government debt from Level 1 to Level 2. Movements of Level 3 instruments Significant transfers into and out of Level 3 occur mainly due to the following reasons: • Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 occur when techniques used for valuing the instrument incorporate significant observable market inputs or broker-dealer quotes which were previously not observable. • Transfers from Level 2 to Level 3 occur when an instrument’s fair value, which was previously determined using valuation techniques with significant observable market inputs, is now determined using valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs. Due to the unobservable nature of the inputs used to value Level 3 financial instruments, there may be uncertainty about the valuation of these instruments. The fair value of Level 3 instruments may be drawn from a range of reasonably possible alternatives. In determining the appropriate levels for these unobservable inputs, parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with prevailing market evidence and management judgment. There were no significant transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 during the years ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. There wer e no other significant changes to the unobservable inputs and sensitivities for assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 during the years ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. (f) RECONCILIATION OF CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE FOR LEVEL 3 The following tables reconcile changes in fair value of all assets and liabilities measured at fair value using significant Level 3 unobservable inputs for the years ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. 162 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS Reconciliation of Changes in Fair Value for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities (millions of Canadian dollars) Fair value as at November 1 2022 Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) Movements4 Transfers Fair value as at October 31 2023 Change in unr ealized gains (losses) on instruments still held5 Included in income1 Included in OCI2,3 Purchases/ Issuances Sales/ Settlements Into Level 3 Out of Level 3 Trading loans, securities, and other Government and government-related securities $ – $ – $ – $ 33 $ – $ 34 $ – $ 67 $ – Other debt securities 49 7 – 111 (145) 95 (52) 65 1 Equity securities – (2) – 41 (29) – – 10 2 49 5 – 185 (174) 129 (52) 142 3 Non-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Securities 845 4 – 187 (56) – – 980 (17) Loans – – – – – – – – – 845 4 – 187 (56) – – 980 (17) Financial assets at fair value thr ough other comprehensive income Other debt securities 60 – (6) 22 (28) – (21) 27 – Equity securities 2,477 – (565) 2,473 (2,008) – – 2,377 (382) $ 2,537 $ – $ (571) $ 2,495 $ (2,036) $ – $ (21) $ 2,404 $ (382) Trading deposits6 $ (416) $ (57) $ – $ (539) $ 30 $ (15) $ 12 $ (985) $ (43) Derivatives7 Interest rate contracts (156) (47) – – 77 – – (126) 25 Foreign exchange contracts 4 (2) – – (1) (8) 1 (6) 2 Equity contracts (59) 35 – 26 (17) (1) (5) (21) 24 Commodity contracts 27 24 – – (52) – – (1) (1) (184) 10 – 26 7 (9) (4) (154) 50 Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (44) (89) – (486) 597 – – (22) (89) Obligations r elated to securities sold short – – – – – – – – – 1 Gains/losses on financial assets and liabilities are recognized within Non-interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. 2 Other comprehensive income. 3 Includes realized gains/losses transferred to retained earnings on disposal of equities designated at FVOCI.

(g) VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 Significant unobservable inputs in Level 3 positions The following section discusses the significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 positions and assesses the potential effect that a change in each unobservable input may have on the fair value measurement. Price Equivalent Certain financial instruments, mainly debt and equity securities, are valued using price equivalents when market prices ar e not available, with fair value measured by comparison with observable pricing data from instruments with similar characteristics. For debt securities, the price equivalent is expr essed in ‘points’, and represents a percentage of the par amount. For equity securities, the price equivalent is based on a percentage of a proxy price. There may be wide ranges depending on the liquidity of the securities. New issuances of debt and equity securities are priced at 100% of the issue price. Correlation The movements of inputs are not necessarily independent from other inputs. Such relationships, where material to the fair value of a given instrument, are captur ed via correlation inputs into the pricing models. The Bank includes correlation between the asset class, as well as across asset classes. For example, price correlation is the relationship between prices of equity securities in equity basket derivatives, and quanto correlation is the relationship between instruments which settle in one currency and the underlying securities which are denominated in another currency. Implied Volatility Implied volatility is the value of the volatility of the underlying instrument which, when input in an option pricing model, such as Black-Scholes, will return a theoretical value equal to the current market price of the option. Implied volatility is a forwar d-looking and subjective measure, and differs from historical volatility because the latter is calculated from known past returns of a security. Funding Ratio The funding ratio is a significant unobservable input required to value loan commitments issued by the Bank. The funding ratio represents an estimate of the percentage of commitments that ar e ultimately funded by the Bank. The funding ratio is based on a number of factors such as observed historical funding percentages within the various lending channels and the future economic outlook, considering factors including, but not limited to, competitive pricing and fixed/variable mortgage rate gap. An increase/ decrease in the funding ratio will increase/decrease loan commitment liability values in relationship to prevailing interest rates. Earnings Multiple, Discount Rate, and Liquidity Discount Earnings multiple, discount rate, and liquidity discount are significant inputs used when valuing certain equity securities. Earnings multiples are selected based on comparable entities and a higher multiple will result in a higher fair value. Discount rates ar e applied to cash flow forecasts to reflect time value of money and the risks associated with the cash flows. A higher discount rate will result in a lower fair value. Liquidity discounts may be applied as a result of the difference in liquidity between the comparable entity and the equity securities being valued. 164 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",
        "summary": "The financial text provides a detailed analysis of TD Bank Group's financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value as of October 31, 2023, compared to the previous year. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Debt Securities and Loans**: The carrying and fair values of government and other debt securities, as well as loans, have decreased from 2022 to 2023. The total financial assets not carried at fair value have increased slightly, indicating a shift in asset composition.\n\n2. **Deposits and Liabilities**: Deposits and securitization liabilities have decreased in both carrying and fair values, while subordinated notes and debentures have also seen a reduction. Overall, total financial liabilities not carried at fair value have decreased.\n\n3. **Fair Value Hierarchy**: The text outlines the fair value hierarchy levels (Level 1, 2, and 3) used for valuation, with most assets and liabilities falling under Level 2, indicating reliance on observable market inputs. There were no significant transfers between levels in 2023, suggesting stability in valuation methods.\n\n4. **Level 3 Instruments**: The reconciliation of changes in fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities shows movements due to purchases, sales, and transfers, with no significant changes in unobservable inputs. This indicates a consistent approach to valuing these complex instruments.\n\n5. **Valuation Techniques**: The text discusses the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 positions, such as price equivalents, correlation, implied volatility, funding ratio, earnings multiple, discount rate, and liquidity discount. These inputs are crucial for determining fair value in the absence of market prices.\n\nOverall, the report highlights a decrease in both assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, with a stable approach to fair value measurement and no significant changes in valuation techniques or inputs."

        "chunk": "Inflation Rate Swap Curve The fair value of inflation rate swap contracts is a swap between the interest rate curve and the inflation index. The inflation rate swap spread is not observable and is determined using proxy inputs such as inflation index rates. Generally, swap curves are observable; however, ther e may be instances where certain specific swap curves are not observable. Net Asset Value The fair value of certain private funds is based on the net asset value determined by the fund managers based on valuation methodologies, as there are no observable prices for these instruments. Valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 assets and liabilities The following table presents the Bank’ s assets and liabilities recognized at fair value and classified as Level 3, together with the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, the significant inputs used in the valuation technique that ar e considered unobservable, and a range of values for those unobservable inputs.

These securities cannot be traded in the market, hence, these securities have not been subjected to the sensitivity analysis. 3 Net asset value information for private funds has not been disclosed due to the wide range in prices for these instruments. The following table summarizes the potential effect of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions for financial assets and financial liabilities held, that are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as at October 31. For non-trading securities at FVTPL and equity securities at FVOCI, the sensitivity was calculated based on an upward and downward shock of the fair value reported. For trading deposits, the sensitivity was calculated by varying unobservable inputs which may include volatility, credit spreads, and correlation. For interest rate derivatives, the Bank performed a sensitivity analysis on the mortgage spreads and unobservable inflation curve. For equity derivatives, the sensitivity was calculated by using reasonably possible alter native assumptions by shocking dividends, correlation, or the price and volatility of the underlying equity instrument. For financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, the sensitivity was calculated based on an upward and downward shock of the funding ratio. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS 165",

(h) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AT FAIR VALUE Securities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss Certain securities supporting insurance reserves within the Bank’s insurance underwriting subsidiaries have been designated at FVTPL to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch. The actuarial valuation of the insurance reserve is measured using a discount factor which is based on the yield of the supporting invested assets, which includes the securities designated at FVTPL, with changes in the discount factor being recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The unrealized gains or losses on securities designated at FVTPL are recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period as gains or losses resulting from changes to the discount rate used to value the insurance liabilities. In addition, certain debt securities have been designated at FVTPL as they are economically hedged with derivatives and the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch. Financial Liabilities Designated at Fair Value through Profit or Loss Certain deposits have been designated at FVTPL to reduce an accounting mismatch from related economic hedges, and are included in Financial liabilities designated at FVTPL on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, certain obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements have been designated at FVTPL as the instruments are part of a portfolio that is managed on a fair value basis and have been included in Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements designated at FVTPL was $7,974 million as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $5,014 million). For financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, the estimated amount that the Bank would be contractually required to pay at maturity, which is based on notional amounts, was $2,897 million less than its fair value as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $288 million). NOTE 6 OFFSETTING FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES | The Bank enters into netting agreements with counterparties (such as clearing houses) to manage the credit risks associated primarily with repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, securities borrowing and lending transactions, and OTC and exchange-traded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar arrangements generally allow the counterparties to set-off liabilities against available assets received. The right to set-off is a legal right to settle or otherwise eliminate all or a portion of an amount due by applying against that amount an amount receivable from the other party. These agreements effectively reduce the Bank’s credit exposure by what it would have been if those same counterparties were liable for the gross exposure on the same underlying contracts. Netting arrangements are typically constituted by a master netting agreement which specifies the general terms of the agreement between the counterparties, including information on the basis of the netting calculation, types of collateral, and the definition of default and other termination events for transactions executed under the agreement. The master netting agreements contain the terms and conditions by which all (or as many as possible) relevant transactions between the counterparties are governed. Multiple individual transactions are subsumed under this general master netting agreement, forming a single legal contract under which the counterparties conduct their relevant mutual business. In addition to the mitigation of credit risk, placing individual transactions under a single master netting agreement that provides for netting of transactions in scope also helps to mitigate settlement risks associated with transacting in multiple jurisdictions or across multiple contracts. These arrangements include clearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements, and global master securities lending agreements. In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into contracts to buy and sell goods and services from various suppliers. Some of these contracts may have netting provisions that allow for the offset of various trade payables and receivables in the event of default of one of the parties. While these are not disclosed in the following table, the gross amount of all payables and receivables to and from the Bank’s vendors is disclosed in Note 16 in accounts receivable and other items, and in Note 18 in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other items. 166 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",
        "summary": "The text provides a sensitivity analysis of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities for TD Bank Group as of October 31, 2023, and 2022. It highlights the impact on net assets due to changes in the fair value of various financial instruments, including trading and non-trading securities, derivatives, and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The analysis shows that the aggregate difference yet to be recognized in net income due to valuation techniques with significant non-observable inputs was immaterial for both years.\n\nThe text also discusses the designation of certain securities and liabilities at FVTPL to eliminate or reduce accounting mismatches, particularly in the context of insurance reserves and economic hedges. The fair value of obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements designated at FVTPL increased from $5,014 million in 2022 to $7,974 million in 2023. Additionally, the bank's netting agreements with counterparties are described as a means to manage credit and settlement risks, allowing for the offsetting of liabilities against available assets, thereby reducing credit exposure. These agreements are typically governed by master netting agreements, which consolidate multiple transactions under a single legal contract."

For non-retail exposures, each borrower is assigned a BRR that reflects the PD of the borrower using proprietary industry and sector specific risk models and expert judgment. Refer to the shaded areas of the “Managing Risk” section of the 2023 MD&A for further details, including the mapping of PD ranges to risk levels for retail exposures as well as the Bank’s 21-point BRR scale to risk levels and external ratings for non-retail exposures. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS 171",
        "summary": "The text provides an overview of the credit quality assessment and management of debt securities and loans by the Bank as of October 31, 2023. The Bank uses internal risk ratings, including Borrower Risk Ratings (BRR) and Facility Risk Ratings (FRR), to evaluate non-retail credit risk on an individual basis. Debt securities are categorized by risk ratings and stages of credit allowances, with investment-grade securities forming the majority. The total debt securities, net of allowance, decreased from the previous year. The Bank's loans and acceptances, including residential mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards, and business loans, have increased compared to the previous year, with a corresponding rise in the allowance for loan losses. The Bank manages retail credit risk using predictive credit scoring and non-retail risk with a 21-point BRR scale. The difference between probability-weighted and base expected credit losses (ECLs) on debt securities was insignificant."

The allowance for credit losses on all remaining financial assets is not significant. (f) FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Relevant macr oeconomic factors are incorporated in risk parameters as appropriate. Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, wher e relevant. The key macroeconomic variables used in determining ECLs include regional unemployment rates for all retail exposures and regional housing price indices for residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. For business and government loans, the key macroeconomic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, and credit spreads. Refer to Note 3 for a discussion of how forward-looking information is generated and considered in determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and in measuring ECLs. Macroeconomic Variables Select macroeconomic variables are projected over the forecast period. The following table represents the average values of the macroeconomic variables over the four calendar quarters starting with the current quarter , and the remaining 4-year forecast period for the base forecast and upside and downside scenarios used in determining the Bank’s ECLs as at October 31, 2023. As the forecast period increases, information about the future becomes less readily available and projections are anchored on assumptions around structural relationships between economic parameters that are inherently much less certain. Restrictive monetary policy is contributing to elevated economic uncertainty and is likely to lead to a near-term deceleration in economic growth and a modest increase in the unemployment rate.

(g) SENSITIVITY OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ECLs are sensitive to the inputs used in internally developed models, the macroeconomic variables in the forward-looking forecasts and r espective probability weightings in determining the probability-weighted ECLs, and other factors considered when applying expert credit judgment. Changes in these inputs, assumptions, models, and judgments would affect the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of ECLs. The following table presents the base ECL scenario compared to the probability-weighted ECLs, with the latter derived from three ECL scenarios for performing loans and of f-balance sheet instruments. The difference reflects the impact of deriving multiple scenarios around the base ECLs and resultant change in ECLs due to non-linearity and sensitivity to using macroeconomic forecasts. Change from Base to Probability-Weighted ECLs (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) As at October 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 7,149 $ 6,599 Base ECLs 6,658 6,095 Difference – in amount $ 491 $ 504 Difference – in percentage 7.4% 8.3% ECLs for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments consist of an aggregate amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 probability-weighted ECLs which are twelve-month ECLs and lifetime ECLs, respectively. Transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2 ECLs result from a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the loan. The following table shows the estimated impact of staging on ECLs by presenting all performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments calculated using twelve-month ECLs compared to the curr ent aggregate probability-weighted ECLs, holding all risk profiles constant. Incremental Lifetime ECLs Impact (millions of Canadian dollars) As at October 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 7,149 $ 6,599 All performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments using 12-month ECLs 5,295 4,819 Incremental lifetime ECLs impact $ 1,854 $ 1,780 (h) FORECLOSED ASSETS Foreclosed assets are repossessed non-financial assets where the Bank gains title, ownership, or possession of individual properties, such as real estate properties, which ar e managed for sale in an orderly manner with the proceeds used to reduce or repay any outstanding debt. The Bank does not generally occupy foreclosed properties for its business use. The Bank predominantly relies on third-party appraisals to determine the carrying value of foreclosed assets. Foreclosed assets held for sale were $59 million as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $51 million), and were recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (i) LOANS PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED A loan is classified as past due when a borrower has failed to make a payment by the contractual due date. The following table summarizes loans that ar e past due but not impaired. Loans less than 31 days contractually past due are excluded as they do not generally reflect a borr ower’s ability to meet their payment obligations.

The gross carrying amount of modified financial assets for which the loss allowance changed from lifetime to twelve- month ECLs during the year ended October 31, 2023 was $144 million (October 31, 2022 – $686 million). | (k) COLLATERAL As at October 31, 2023, the collateral held against total gross impaired loans represents 77% (October 31, 2022 – 78%) of total gross impaired loans. The fair value of non-financial collateral is determined at the origination date of the loan. A revaluation of non-financial collateral is performed if there has been a significant change in the terms and conditions of the loan and/or the loan is considered impaired. Management considers the nature of the collateral, seniority ranking of the debt, and loan structure in assessing the value of collateral. These estimated cash flows are reviewed at least annually, or more frequently when new information indicates a change in the timing or amount expected to be received. NOTE 9 TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The Bank securitizes loans through structured entity or non-structured entity third parties. Most loan securitizations do not qualify for derecognition since in most circumstances, the Bank continues to be exposed to substantially all of the prepayment, interest rate, and/or credit risk associated with the securitized financial assets and has not transferred substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership of the securitized assets. Where loans do not qualify for derecognition, they are not derecognized from the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, retained interests are not recognized, and a securitization liability is recognized for the cash proceeds received. Certain transaction costs incurred are also capitalized and amortized using EIRM. The Bank securitizes insured residential mortgages under the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA MBS) program sponsored by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). The MBS that are created through the NHA MBS program are sold to the Canada Housing Trust (CHT) as part of the CMB program, sold to third-party investors, or are held by the Bank. The CHT issues CMB to third-party investors and uses resulting proceeds to purchase NHA MBS from the Bank and other mortgage issuers in the Canadian market. Assets purchased by the CHT are commingled in a single trust from which CMB are issued. The Bank continues to be exposed to substantially all of the risks of the underlying mortgages, through the retention of a seller swap which transfers principal and interest payment risk on the NHA MBS back to the Bank in return for coupon paid on the CMB issuance and as such, the sales do not qualify for derecognition. The Bank securitizes U.S. originated residential mortgages with U.S. government agencies which qualify for derecognition from the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. As part of the securitization, the Bank retains the right to service the transferred mortgage loans. The MBS that are created through the securitization are typically sold to third-party investors. The Bank also securitizes business and government loans to entities which may be structured entities. These securitizations may give rise to derecognition of the financial assets depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In addition, the Bank transfers credit card receivables to structured entities that the Bank consolidates. Refer to Note 10 for further details. The following table summarizes the securitized asset types that did not qualify for derecognition, along with their associated securitization liabilities as at October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. Financial Assets Not Qualifying for Derecognition Treatment as Part of the Bank’s Securitization Programs (millions of Canadian dollars) As at October 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 Fair value Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Nature of transaction Securitization of residential mortgage loans $ 23,835 $ 24,433 $ 22,043 $ 22,684 Other financial assets transferred related to securitization1 3,554 3,571 5,199 5,285 Total 27,389 28,004 27,242 27,969 Associated liabilities2 $ 26,457 $ 27,131 $ 26,978 $ 27,684 1 Includes asset-backed securities, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), cash, repurchase agreements, and Government of Canada securities used to fulfil funding requirements of the Bank’s securitization structures after the initial securitization of mortgage loans. 2 Includes securitization liabilities carried at amortized cost of $13 billion as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $15 billion), and securitization liabilities carried at fair value of $14 billion as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $13 billion). Other Financial Assets Not Qualifying for Derecognition The Bank enters into certain transactions where it transfers previously recognized commodities and financial assets, such as debt and equity securities, but retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of those assets. These transferred assets are not derecognized and the transfers are accounted for as financing transactions. The most common transactions of this nature are repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements, in which the Bank retains substantially all of the associated credit, price, interest rate, and foreign exchange risks and rewards associated with the assets. The following table summarizes the carrying amount of financial assets and the associated transactions that did not qualify for derecognition, as well as their associated financial liabilities as at October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022. Other Financial Assets Not Qualifying for Derecognition (millions of Canadian dollars) As at October 31 2023 October 31 2022 Carrying amount of assets Nature of transaction Repurchase agreements1,2 $ 27,782 $ 26,281 Securities lending agreements 40,333 45,667 Total 68,115 71,948 Carrying amount of associated liabilities2 $ 28,037 $ 26,785 1 Includes $3.6 billion, as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $3.5 billion) of assets related to repurchase agreements or swaps that are collateralized by physical precious metals. 2 Associated liabilities are all related to repurchase agreements. 178 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",
        "summary": "The financial text provides insights into the handling of modified financial assets, collateral, and securitization activities by a bank as of October 31, 2023. Key points include:\n\n1. **Modified Financial Assets**: The amortized cost of financial assets modified during the year increased to $389 million from $296 million in 2022, with minimal modification gains or losses. The gross carrying amount of assets with loss allowance changes from lifetime to twelve-month expected credit losses (ECLs) decreased significantly from $686 million in 2022 to $144 million in 2023.\n\n2. **Collateral**: Collateral held against impaired loans covers 77% of total gross impaired loans, slightly down from 78% in 2022. The fair value of non-financial collateral is assessed at loan origination and revalued if significant changes occur.\n\n3. **Securitization**: The bank engages in securitizing loans, primarily residential mortgages, through various programs. Most securitizations do not qualify for derecognition, meaning the bank retains significant risks and rewards. The bank's securitization liabilities were $27.1 billion in 2023, slightly down from $27.7 billion in 2022. U.S. residential mortgages securitized with government agencies qualify for derecognition.\n\n4. **Other Financial Assets**: The bank also engages in transactions like repurchase and securities lending agreements, where it retains risks and rewards, thus not qualifying for derecognition. The carrying amount of these assets was $68.1 billion in 2023, with associated liabilities of $28 billion.\n\nOverall, the bank's financial activities reflect a cautious approach to risk retention in securitization and asset modification, with a focus on maintaining collateral coverage for impaired loans."

        "chunk": "Transferred financial assets that are derecognized in their entirety where the Bank has a continuing involvement Continuing involvement may arise if the Bank retains any contractual rights or obligations subsequent to the transfer of financial assets. Certain business and government loans securitized by the Bank are derecognized from the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. In instances where the Bank fully derecognizes business and government loans, the Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through a retained interest. As at October 31, 2023, the fair value of retained interests was $3 million (October 31, 2022 – $5 million). A gain or loss on sale of the loans is recognized immediately in other income (loss) after considering the effect | of hedge accounting on the assets sold, if applicable. The amount of the gain or loss recognized depends on the previous carrying values of the loans involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer. Certain portfolios of U.S. residential mortgages originated by the Bank are sold and derecognized from the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. In certain instances, the Bank has a continuing involvement to service those loans. As at October 31, 2023, the carrying value of these servicing rights was $92 million (October 31, 2022 – $103 million) and the fair value was $150 million (October 31, 2022 – $155 million). A gain or loss on sale of the loans is recognized immediately in other income (loss). The gain (loss) on sale of the loans for the year ended October 31, 2023 was ($40) million (October 31, 2022 – ($68) million). NOTE 10 STRUCTURED ENTITIES The Bank uses structured entities for a variety of purposes including: (1) to facilitate the transfer of specified risks to clients; (2) as financing vehicles for itself or for clients; or (3) to segregate assets on behalf of investors. The Bank is typically restricted from accessing the assets of the structured entity under the relevant arrangements. The Bank is involved with structured entities that it sponsors, as well as entities sponsored by third parties. Factors assessed when determining if the Bank is the sponsor of a structured entity include whether the Bank is the predominant user of the entity; whether the entity’s branding or marketing identity is linked with the Bank; and whether the Bank provides an implicit or explicit guarantee of the entity’s performance to investors or other third parties. The Bank is not considered to be the sponsor of a structured entity if it only provides arm’s-length services to the entity, for example, by acting as administrator, distributor, custodian, asset manager, or loan servicer. Sponsorship of a structured entity may indicate that the Bank had power over the entity at inception; however, this is not sufficient to determine if the Bank consolidates the entity. Regardless of whether or not the Bank sponsors an entity, consolidation is determined on a case-by-case basis. (a) SPONSORED STRUCTURED ENTITIES The following section outlines the Bank’s involvement with key sponsored structured entities. Securitizations The Bank securitizes its own assets and facilitates the securitization of client assets through structured entities, such as conduits, which issue ABCP or other securitization entities which issue longer-dated term securities. Securitizations are an important source of liquidity for the Bank, allowing it to diversify its funding sources and to optimize its balance sheet management approach. The Bank sponsors both single-seller and multi-seller securitization conduits. Depending on the specifics of the entity, the variable returns absorbed through ABCP may be significantly mitigated by variable returns retained by the sellers. The Bank provides liquidity facilities to certain conduits for the benefit of ABCP investors which are structured as loan facilities between the Bank, as the sole liquidity lender, and the Bank- sponsored entity. If an entity experiences difficulty issuing ABCP due to illiquidity in the commercial market, the entity may draw on the loan facility, and use the proceeds to pay maturing ABCP . The ABCP issued by each multi-seller conduit is in the conduit’s own name with recourse to the financial assets owned by the multi-seller conduit, and is non-recourse to the Bank except through our participation in liquidity facilities. The Bank’s exposure to the variable returns of these conduits from its provision of liquidity facilities and any related commitments is mitigated by the sellers’ continued exposure to variable returns through the provision of first loss protection, as described below. The Bank provides administration and securities distribution services to its sponsored securitization conduits, which may result in it holding an investment in the ABCP issued by these entities. In some cases, the Bank may also provide credit enhancements or may transact derivatives with securitization conduits. The Bank earns fees from the conduits which are recognized when earned. The Bank sells assets to single-seller conduits which it controls and consolidates. Control results from the Bank’s power over the entity’s key economic decisions, predominantly, the mix of assets sold into the conduit and exposure to the variable returns of the transferred assets, usually through a derivative or the provision of credit mitigation in the form of cash reserves, over-collateralization, or guarantees over the performance of the entity’s portfolio of assets. Multi-seller conduits provide sellers with alternate sources of financing through the securitization of their assets. These conduits are similar to single-seller conduits except that financial assets are purchased from more than one seller and commingled into a single portfolio of assets. Each transaction is structured with transaction-specific first loss protection provided by the third-party seller. This enhancement can take various forms, including but not limited to overcollateralization, excess spread, subordinated classes of financial assets, guarantees or letters of credit. The Bank is typically deemed to have power over the entity’s key economic decisions, namely, the selection of sellers and related assets sold as well as other decisions related to the management of risk in the vehicle. Where the Bank has power over multi-seller conduits, but is not exposed to significant variable returns it does not consolidate such entities. Where the Bank is exposed to variable returns of a multi-seller conduit from provision of certain types of liquidity facilities, together with power over the entity as well as the ability to use its power to influence significant variable returns, the Bank consolidates the conduit. Investment Funds and Other Asset Management Entities As part of its asset management business, the Bank creates investment funds and trusts (including mutual funds), enabling it to provide its clients with a broad range of diversified exposure to different risk profiles, in accordance with the client’s risk appetite. Such entities may be actively managed or may be passively directed, for example, through the tracking of a specified index, depending on the entity’s investment strategy. Financing for these entities is obtained through the issuance of securities to investors, typically in the form of fund units. Based on each entity’s specific strategy and risk profile, the proceeds from this issuance are used by the entity to purchase a portfolio of assets. An entity’s portfolio may contain investments in securities, derivatives, or other assets, including cash. At the inception of a new investment fund or trust, the Bank will typically invest an amount of seed capital in the entity, allowing it to establish a performance history in the market. Over time, the Bank sells its seed capital holdings to third-party investors, as the entity’s AUM increases. As a result, the Bank’s holding of seed capital investment in its own sponsored investment funds and trusts is typically not significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Aside from any seed capital investments, the Bank’s interest in these entities is generally limited to fees earned for the provision of asset management services. The Bank does not typically provide guarantees over the performance of these funds. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS 179",
        "summary": "The text discusses the financial practices of a bank regarding the transfer and derecognition of financial assets, involvement with structured entities, and asset management activities. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Derecognition of Financial Assets**: The bank derecognizes certain business and government loans, as well as U.S. residential mortgages, from its balance sheet. Despite full derecognition, the bank may retain some risks through retained interests or servicing rights. As of October 31, 2023, the fair value of retained interests was $3 million, and the servicing rights were valued at $92 million.\n\n2. **Structured Entities**: The bank uses structured entities for risk transfer, financing, and asset segregation. It sponsors securitization conduits, both single-seller and multi-seller, to diversify funding sources and manage its balance sheet. The bank provides liquidity facilities and may hold investments in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by these entities. Control and consolidation of these entities depend on the bank's power over economic decisions and exposure to variable returns.\n\n3. **Investment Funds and Asset Management**: The bank creates investment funds and trusts to offer clients diversified risk exposure. It initially invests seed capital in these entities, which is later sold to third-party investors. The bank's involvement is primarily through asset management fees, with limited financial exposure beyond seed capital investments.\n\nOverall, the bank's financial strategies involve complex arrangements to manage risk, liquidity, and funding while maintaining a focus on asset management and client services."

        "chunk": "The Bank is typically considered to have power over the key economic decisions of sponsored asset management entities; however, it does not consolidate an entity unless it is also exposed to significant variable returns of the entity. This determination is made on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the Bank’s consolidation policy. Financing Vehicles The Bank may use structured entities to provide a cost-effective means of financing its operations, including raising capital or obtaining funding. These structured entities include TD Covered Bond (Legislative) Guarantor Limited Partnership (the “Cover ed Bond Entity”). The Bank issues, or has issued, debt under its covered bond program where the principal and interest payments of the notes ar e guaranteed by the Covered Bond Entity. The Bank sold a portfolio of assets to the Covered Bond Entity and provided a loan to the Covered Bond Entity to facilitate the purchase. The Bank is restricted from accessing the Covered Bond Entity’s assets under the relevant agreement. Investors in the Bank’s covered bonds may have recourse to the Bank should the assets of the Covered Bond Entity be insufficient to satisfy the covered bond liabilities. The Bank consolidates the Covered Bond Entity as it has power over the key economic activities and retains all the variable returns in this entity. (b) THIRD-PARTY SPONSORED STRUCTURED ENTITIES In addition to structured entities sponsor ed by the Bank, the Bank is also involved with structured entities sponsored by thir d parties. Key involvement with third-party sponsored structured entities is described in the following section. Third-party Sponsored Securitization Programs The Bank participates in the securitization programs of government- sponsored structured entities, including the CMHC, a Cr own corporation of the Government of Canada, and similar U.S. government-sponsored entities. CMHC guarantees both NHA MBS and CMB which are issued through the CHT. The Bank is exposed to the variable returns in the CHT, through its retention of seller swaps resulting fr om its participation in the CHT program. The Bank does not have power over the CHT as its key economic activities are controlled by the Government of Canada. The Bank’s exposure to the CHT is included in the balance of residential mortgage loans as noted in Note 9, and is not disclosed in the table accompanying this Note. The Bank participates in the securitization programs sponsored by U.S. government agencies. The Bank is not exposed to significant variable returns from these agencies and does not have power over the key economic activities of these agencies, which are controlled by the U.S. government. Investment Holdings and Derivatives The Bank may hold interests in third-party structured entities, predominantly in the form of direct investments in securities or partnership inter ests issued by those structured entities, or through derivatives transacted with counterparties which are structured entities. Investments in, and derivatives with, structured entities are recognized on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Bank does not typically consolidate third- party structured entities where its involvement is limited to investment holdings and/or derivatives as the Bank would not generally have power over the key economic decisions of these entities. Financing Transactions In the normal course of business, the Bank may enter into financing transactions with third-party structured entities including commer cial loans, reverse repurchase agreements, prime brokerage margin lending, and similar collateralized lending transactions. While such transactions expose the Bank to the structured entities’ counterparty credit risk, this exposure is mitigated by the collateral related to these transactions. The Bank typically has neither power nor significant variable returns due to financing transactions with structur ed entities and would not generally consolidate such entities. Financing transactions with third-party sponsored structured entities are included on the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements and have not been included in the table accompanying this Note. Arm’s-length Servicing Relationships In addition to the involvement outlined above, the Bank may also provide services to structured entities on an arm’s-length basis, for example as sub-advisor to an investment fund or asset servicer. Similarly , the Bank’s asset management services provided to institutional investors may include transactions with structured entities. As a consequence of providing these services, the Bank may be exposed to variable returns from these structured entities, for example, through the receipt of fees or short-term exposure to the structured entity’s securities. Any such exposure is typically mitigated by collateral or some other contractual arrangement with the structured entity or its sponsor. The Bank generally has neither power nor significant variable returns from the provision of arm’s-length services to a structured entity and, consequently does not consolidate such entities. Fees and other exposures through servicing relationships are included on the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements and have not been included in the table accompanying this Note. (c) INVOLVEMENT WITH CONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES Securitizations The Bank securitizes credit card receivables through securitization entities, predominantly single-seller conduits. These conduits are consolidated by the Bank based on the factors described above. Aside from the exposur e resulting from its involvement as seller and sponsor of consolidated securitization conduits described above, including the liquidity facilities provided, the Bank has no contractual or non-contractual arrangements to provide financial support to consolidated securitization conduits. The Bank’s interests in securitization conduits generally rank senior to interests held by other parties, in accordance with the Bank’s investment and risk policies. As a result, the Bank has no significant obligations to absorb losses before other holders of securitization issuances. Other Consolidated Structured Entities Depending on the specific facts and circumstances of the Bank’s involvement with structured entities, the Bank may consolidate asset management entities, financing vehicles, or third-party sponsor ed structured entities, based on the factors described above. Aside from its exposure resulting from its involvement as sponsor or investor in the structured entities as previously discussed, the Bank does not typically have other contractual or non-contractual arrangements to provide financial support to these consolidated structured entities. (d) INVOLVEMENT WITH UNCONSOLIDATED The following table presents information r elated to the Bank’s unconsolidated structured entities. Unconsolidated structured entities include both TD and thir d-party sponsored entities. Securitizations include holdings in TD-sponsored multi-seller conduits, as well as third-party sponsored mortgage and asset-backed securitizations, including government-sponsored agency securities such as CMBs, and U.S. government agency issuances. Investment Funds and Trusts include holdings in third-party funds and trusts, as well as holdings in TD-sponsored asset management funds and trusts and commitments to certain U.S. municipal funds. Amounts in Other are mainly related to investments in community-based U.S. tax-advantage entities described in Note 12. These holdings do not result in the consolidation of these entities as TD does not have power over these entities. 180 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",
        "summary": "The text outlines the involvement of a bank with various structured entities and its consolidation policy. The bank consolidates entities when it has power over key economic activities and is exposed to significant variable returns. It uses structured entities like the TD Covered Bond Entity for financing, where it retains control and consolidates these entities. The bank also participates in third-party sponsored securitization programs, such as those by the CMHC and U.S. government agencies, but does not consolidate these as it lacks control and significant exposure. The bank's involvement with third-party structured entities through investments, derivatives, and financing transactions typically does not lead to consolidation due to limited power and exposure. Additionally, the bank provides arm's-length services to structured entities, which do not result in consolidation. The bank consolidates securitization conduits for credit card receivables and other structured entities when it meets the criteria of control and exposure. Unconsolidated entities include both bank-sponsored and third-party entities where the bank lacks control."

Sponsored Unconsolidated Structured Entities in which the Bank has no Significant Investment at the End of the Period Sponsored unconsolidated structured entities in which the Bank has no significant investment at the end of the period are predominantly investment funds and trusts created for the asset management business. The Bank would not typically hold investments, with the exception of seed capital, in these structured entities. However, the Bank continues to earn fees from asset management services provided to these entities, some of which could be based on the performance of the fund. Fees payable are generally senior in the entity’s priority of payment and would also be backed by collateral, limiting the Bank’s exposure to loss from these entities. The Bank earned non-interest income of $2.1 billion (October 31, 2022 − $2.3 billion) from its involvement with these asset management entities for the year ended October 31, 2023, of which $1.9 billion (October 31, 2022 − $2.0 billion) was received directly from these entities. The total AUM in these entities as at October 31, 2023 was $253.1 billion (October 31, 2022 − $251.7 billion). Any assets transferred by the Bank during the period are commingled with assets obtained from third parties in the market. Except as previously disclosed, the Bank has no contractual or non-contractual arrangements to provide financial support to unconsolidated structured entities. NOTE 11 DERIVATIVES | (a) DERIVATIVE PRODUCT TYPES AND RISK EXPOSURES The majority of the Bank’s derivative contracts are OTC transactions that are bilaterally negotiated between the Bank and the counterparty to the contract. The remainder are exchange-traded contracts transacted through organized and regulated exchanges and consist primarily of options and futures. The Bank’s derivative transactions relate to trading and non-trading activities. The purpose of derivatives held for non-trading activities is primarily for managing interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity risk related to the Bank’s funding, lending, investment, and other structural market risk management activities. The Bank’s risk management strategy for these risks is discussed in shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the MD&A. Where hedge accounting is applied, only specific or a combination of risk components are hedged, including benchmark interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and equity price components. All these risk components are observable in the relevant market environment and the change in the fair value or the variability in cash flows attributable to these risk components can be reliably measured for hedged items. The Bank also enters into derivative transactions to economically hedge certain exposures that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting, or where hedge accounting is not considered feasible. TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS 181",
        "summary": "The financial text provides a detailed overview of the carrying amounts and maximum exposure to unconsolidated structured entities for a bank as of October 31, 2023, compared to the previous year. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Asset and Liability Overview**: The total assets related to unconsolidated structured entities decreased from $209.927 billion in 2022 to $186.463 billion in 2023. Total liabilities increased from $2.774 billion to $5.348 billion over the same period.\n\n2. **Maximum Exposure to Loss**: The bank's maximum exposure to loss from these entities decreased from $230.191 billion in 2022 to $207.278 billion in 2023.\n\n3. **Off-Balance Sheet Exposure**: There was an increase in off-balance sheet exposure from $23.038 billion in 2022 to $26.163 billion in 2023.\n\n4. **Sponsored Entities**: The size of sponsored unconsolidated structured entities increased slightly from $45.315 billion in 2022 to $47.815 billion in 2023. The bank does not hold significant investments in these entities but earns fees from asset management services, totaling $2.1 billion in 2023.\n\n5. **Derivative Activities**: The bank engages in both OTC and exchange-traded derivative transactions for trading and non-trading purposes, primarily to manage interest rate, foreign exchange, and equity risks. Hedge accounting is applied selectively, and some derivatives are used for economic hedging without qualifying for hedge accounting.\n\nOverall, the bank's involvement with unconsolidated structured entities shows a reduction in exposure and assets, with a focus on managing risks through derivatives and earning income from asset management services."

        "page_range": "184-185",
        "chunk": "Where the derivatives are in hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness can be attributed to differences between hedging instruments and hedged items: • Differences in fixed rates, when contractual coupons of the fixed rate hedged items are designated; • Differences in the discounting factors, when hedging derivatives are collateralized; • CVA on the hedging derivatives; and • Mismatch in critical terms such as tenor and timing of cash flows between hedging instruments and hedged items. To mitigate a portion of the ineffectiveness, the Bank designates the benchmark risk component of contractual cash flows of hedged items and executes hedging derivatives with high-quality counterparties. The majority of the Bank’s hedging derivatives are collateralized. Interest Rate Derivatives Inter est rate swaps are OTC contracts in which two counterparties agree to exchange cash flows over a period of time based on rates applied to a specified notional amount. This includes interest rate swaps that are transacted and settled thr ough a clearing house which acts as a central counterparty. A typical interest rate swap would require one counterparty to pay a fixed market interest rate in exchange for a variable market interest rate determined from time to time, with both calculated on a specified notional amount. No exchange of principal amount takes place. Forward rate agreements are OTC contracts that effectively fix a future interest rate for a period of time. A typical forward rate agr eement provides that at a pre-determined future date, a cash settlement will be made between the counterparties based upon the difference between a contracted rate and a market rate to be determined in the future, calculated on a specified notional amount. No exchange of principal amount takes place. Interest rate options are contracts in which one party (the purchaser of an option) acquires from another party (the writer of an option), in exchange for a pr emium, the right, but not the obligation, either to buy or sell, on a specified future date or series of future dates or within a specified time, a specified financial instrument at a contracted price. The underlying financial instrument will have a market price which varies in response to changes in interest rates. In managing the Bank’s interest rate exposure, the Bank acts as both a writer and purchaser of these options. Options are transacted both OTC and through exchanges. Interest rate futures are standardized contracts transacted on an exchange, with interest bearing instruments as the underlying refer ence assets. These contracts differ from forward rate agreements in that they are in standard amounts with standard settlement dates and are transacted on an exchange. The Bank uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to benchmark interest rate risk by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of existing and/or for ecast assets and liabilities, including funding and investment activities. These swaps are designated in either fair value hedges against fixed rate assets/liabilities or cash flow hedges against floating rate assets/liabilities. For fair value hedges, the Bank assesses and measures the hedge effectiveness based on the change in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument relative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the Bank uses a hypothetical derivative having terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged item as the proxy for measuring the change in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Foreign Exchange Derivatives Foreign exchange forwards are OTC contracts in which one counterparty contracts with another to exchange a specified amount of one currency for a specified amount of a second currency, at a future date or range of dates. Swap contracts comprise foreign exchange swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps. Foreign exchange swaps are transactions in which a foreign currency is simultaneously purchased in the spot market and sold in the forward market, or vice-versa. Cross-currency interest rate swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange principal and interest cash flows in different currencies over a period of time. These contracts are used to manage currency and/or interest rate exposures. Foreign exchange futures contracts are similar to foreign exchange forward contracts but differ in that they ar e in standard currency amounts with standard settlement dates and are transacted on an exchange. The Bank uses non-derivative instruments such as foreign currency deposit liabilities and derivative instruments such as cross-currency swaps and for eign exchange forwards to hedge its foreign currency exposure. These hedging instruments are designated in either net investment hedges or cash flow hedges. For net investment hedges, the Bank assesses and measures the hedge effectiveness based on the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument relative to the translation gains and losses on the net investment in the foreign operation. For cash flow hedges, the Bank assesses and measures the hedge effectiveness based on the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument relative to the change in the cash flows of the foreign currency denominated asset/liability attributable to foreign exchange risk, using the hypothetical derivative method. Credit Derivatives The Bank uses credit derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS) and total return swaps to manage risks in the Bank’ s corporate loan portfolio and other cash instruments, as well as managing counterparty credit risk on derivatives. Credit risk is the risk of loss if a borrower or counterparty in a transaction fails to meet its agreed payment obligations. The Bank uses credit derivatives to mitigate industry concentration and borrower-specific exposure as part of the Bank’s portfolio risk management techniques. The credit, legal, and other risks associated with these transactions are controlled through well established procedures. The Bank’s policy is to enter into these transactions with investment grade financial institutions. Credit risk to these counterparties is managed through the same approval, limit, and monitoring processes that is used for all counterparties to which the Bank has credit exposure. Credit derivatives are OTC contracts designed to transfer the credit risk in an underlying financial instrument (usually termed as a reference asset) fr om one counterparty to another. The most common credit derivatives are CDS, which include contracts transacted through clearing houses, and total return swaps. In CDS contracts, the CDS purchaser acquires credit protection on a reference asset or group of assets from a writer of CDS in exchange for a premium. The purchaser may pay the agreed premium at inception or over a period of time. The credit protection compensates the purchaser for deterioration in value of the reference asset or group of assets upon the occurrence of certain credit events such as bankruptcy, or changes in specified credit rating or credit index. Settlement may be cash based or physical, requiring the delivery of the reference asset to the CDS writer. In total return swap contracts, one counterparty agrees to pay or receive from the other cash amounts based on changes in the value of a reference asset or group of assets, including any returns such as interest earned on these assets in exchange for amounts that are based on prevailing market funding rates. These cash settlements are made regardless of whether there is a credit event. Other Derivatives The Bank also transacts in equity and commodity derivatives in both exchange and OTC markets. Equity swaps are OTC contracts in which one counterparty agrees to pay, or receive fr om the other, cash amounts based on changes in the value of a stock index, a basket of stocks or a single stock. These contracts sometimes include a payment in respect of dividends. Equity options give the purchaser of the option, for a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to buy from or sell to the writer of an option, an underlying stock index, basket of stocks or a single stock at a contracted price. Options are transacted both OTC and thr ough exchanges. Equity index futures are standardized contracts transacted on an exchange. They are based on an agreement to pay or r eceive a cash amount based on the difference between the contracted price level of an underlying stock index and its corresponding market price level at a specified future date. There is no actual delivery of stocks that comprise the underlying index. These contracts are in standard amounts with standard settlement dates. 182 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS Equity forwards are OTC contracts in which one counterparty contracts with another to buy or sell a single stock or stock index, or to settle the contract in cash based on changes in the value of a reference asset, at a future date. Commodity contracts include commodity forwards, futures, swaps, and options, such as precious metals and energy-related pr oducts in both OTC and exchange markets. The Bank applies hedge accounting on certain equity forwards and/or total return swaps to hedge exposur e to equity price risk. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. The Bank assesses and measures the hedge effectiveness based on the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument relative to the change in the cash flows of the hedged item attributable to movement in equity price, using the hypothetical derivative method.

Cross-currency swaps in both types of hedge relationships are disclosed in the above risk category (foreign exchange risk). 3 Certain cross-currency swaps are executed using multiple derivatives, including interest rate swaps. The notional amount of these interest rate swaps, excluded from the above, is $178.3 billion as at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $153.6 billion). 4 Includes derivatives executed to manage non-trading foreign currency exposures, when more than one currency is involved prior to hedging to the Canadian dollar, or when the currency pair is not a significant exposure for the Bank. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform The Bank’s hedging relationships no longer have exposure to USD LIBOR, but continue to have exposure to CDOR benchmark rates. As a result of IBOR reform, CDOR benchmark rates are subject to discontinuance, or may become illiquid after the adoption of ARRs as established benchmark rates. Judgment may be requir ed in determining whether certain hedging relationships that involve hedging changes in fair value or variability of cash flows attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange risk continue to qualify for hedge accounting. Impacted hedging relationships will continue to be monitored for all remaining benchmark rates still subject to ARR transition. As the new ARRs will differ from the prior benchmark rates, new or revised hedging strategies may be requir ed to better align derivative hedging instruments with hedged items. Given ongoing market developments, the assessment of the impact on the Bank’s hedging strategies and its mitigation plans is progressing. As at October 31, 2023, the Bank has transitioned all derivative instruments designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships referencing USD LIBOR to an ARR and it no longer has exposure to any residual USD LIBOR derivative notional amounts (October 31, 2022 – $148 billion). The following table discloses the notional amount of derivative instruments designated in qualifying hedge accounting r elationships referencing CDOR that have yet to transition to an ARR and mature after June 28, 2024.

Notional amounts are used to calculate cash flows in derivative contracts but do not reflect market or credit risk. The report categorizes derivatives into interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and other contracts, with significant figures provided for each category. The total notional amount of derivatives increased from 2022 to 2023. The text also discusses the use of derivatives for hedging purposes, distinguishing between those in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and those not. Additionally, it addresses the impact of interest rate benchmark reforms, noting that the bank has transitioned away from USD LIBOR to alternative reference rates (ARRs) and continues to monitor the transition from CDOR. The report highlights the importance of collateral and central clearing houses in managing counterparty and settlement risks."

Both these types of hedges are disclosed under the Foreign exchange risk as the risk category. (c) DERIVATIVE-RELATED RISKS Market Risk Derivatives, in the absence of any compensating upfront cash payments, generally have no market value at inception. They obtain value, positive or negative, as relevant interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity, commodity or credit prices or indices change, such that the pr eviously contracted terms of the derivative transactions have become more or less favourable than what can be negotiated under current market conditions for contracts with the same terms and the same remaining period to expiry. The potential for derivatives to increase or decrease in value as a result of the foregoing factors is generally referred to as market risk. Credit Risk Credit risk on derivatives, also known as counterparty credit risk, is the risk of a financial loss occurring as a result of the failure of a counterparty to meet its obligation to the Bank. Derivative-related credit risks are subject to the same cr edit approval, limit and monitoring standards that are used for managing other transactions that create credit exposure. This includes evaluating the cr editworthiness of counterparties, and managing the size, diversification and maturity structure of the portfolios. The Bank actively engages in risk mitigation strategies through the use of multi-product derivative master netting agreements, collateral and other risk mitigation techniques. Master netting agreements reduce risk to the Bank by allowing the Bank to close out and net transactions with counterparties subject to such agreements upon the occurrence of certain events. The current replacement cost and credit equivalent amount shown in the following table are based on the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk. According to this approach, the current replacement cost accounts for the fair value of the positions, posted and received collateral, and master netting agreement clauses. The credit equivalent amount is the sum of the current replacement cost and the potential future exposure, which is calculated by applying factors determined by OSFI to the notional principal amount of the derivatives. The risk-weighted amount is determined by applying the adequate risk weights to the credit equivalent amount.

Certain of the Bank’s derivative contracts are governed by master derivative agreements having provisions that may permit the Bank’s counterparties to require, upon the occurrence of a certain contingent event: (1) the posting of collateral or other acceptable remedy such as assignment of the affected contracts to an acceptable counterparty; or (2) settlement of outstanding derivative contracts. Most often, these contingent events are in the form of a downgrade of the senior debt rating of the Bank, either as counterparty or as guarantor of one of the Bank’s subsidiaries. At October 31, 2023, the aggregate net liability position of those contracts would require: (1) the posting of collateral or other acceptable remedy totalling $407 million (October 31, 2022 – $392 million) in the event of a one-notch or two-notch downgrade in the Bank’s senior debt rating; and (2) funding totalling nil (October 31, 2022 – nil) following the termination and settlement of outstanding derivative contracts in the event of a one-notch or two-notch downgrade in the Bank’s senior debt rating. Certain of the Bank’s derivative contracts are governed by master derivative agreements having credit support provisions that permit the Bank’s counterparties to call for collateral depending on the net mark-to-market exposure position of all derivative contracts governed by that master derivative agreement. Some of these agreements may permit the Bank’s counterparties to require, upon the downgrade of the credit rating of the Bank, to post additional collateral. As at October 31, 2023, the fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was $16 billion (October 31, 2022 – $19 billion). The Bank has posted $16 billion (October 31, 2022 – $18 billion) of collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business. As at October 31, 2023, the impact of a one-notch downgrade in the Bank’s credit rating would require the Bank to post an additional $147 million (October 31, 2022 – $174 million) of collateral to that posted in the normal course of business. A two-notch downgrade in the Bank’s credit rating would require the Bank to post an additional $223 million (October 31, 2022 – $269 million) of collateral to that posted in the normal course of business. NOTE 12 INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES | The Bank has significant influence over The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) and the ability to participate in the financial and operating policy-making decisions of Schwab through a combination of the Bank’s ownership, board representation and the insured deposit account agreement between the Bank and Schwab (the “Schwab IDA Agreement”). As such, the Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The Bank’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. The Bank takes into account changes in the one-month lag period that would significantly affect the results. On August 1, 2022, in order to provide the capital required for the acquisition of Cowen Inc. (“Cowen”), the Bank sold 28.4 million non- voting common shares of Schwab at a price of US$66.53 per share for proceeds of $2.5 billion (US$1.9 billion). The Bank recognized $997 million as other income (net of $368 million loss from AOCI reclassified to earnings), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. As at October 31, 2023, the Bank’s reported investment in Schwab was approximately 12.4% (October 31, 2022 – 12.1%), consisting of 9.8% of the outstanding voting common shares and the remainder in non-voting common shares of Schwab with a fair value of $16 billion (US$12 billion) (October 31, 2022 – $24 billion (US$18 billion)) based on the closing price of US$52.04 (October 31, 2022 – US$79.67) on the New York Stock Exchange. The Bank and Schwab are party to a stockholder agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”) under which the Bank has the right to designate two members of Schwab’s Board of Directors and has representation on two Board Committees, subject to the Bank meeting certain conditions. The Bank’s designated directors currently are the Bank’s Group President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank’s Chair of the Board. Under the Stockholder Agreement, the Bank is not permitted to own more than 9.9% voting common shares of Schwab, and the Bank is subject to customary standstill restrictions and, subject to certain exceptions, transfer restrictions.

Under the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into an amended insured deposit account agreement (the “2023 Schwab IDA Agreement”), which replaced the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement. Pursuant to the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank continues to make sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Schwab designates a portion of the deposits with the Bank as fixed-rate obligation amounts (FROA). Remaining deposits over the minimum level of FROA are designated as floating-rate obligations. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by three years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until September 2025, the aggregate FROA will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to $6.8 billion (US$5 billion) of FROA by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to certain limits. During the year ended October 31, 2023, Schwab exercised its option to buy down $6.1 billion (US$4.5 billion) of FROA and paid $305 million (US$227 million) in termination fees to the Bank in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement. The fees are intended to compensate the Bank for losses incurred this year from discontinuing certain hedging relationships, as well as for lost revenues. The net impact is recorded in net interest income. Except for Schwab as disclosed above, the Bank did not have investments in associates or joint ventures which were individually material as of October 31, 2023, or October 31, 2022. The carrying amount of the Bank’s investment in other associates and joint ventures as at October 31, 2023 was $4.2 billion (October 31, 2022 – $3.8 billion). Other associates and joint ventures consisted predominantly of investments in private funds or partnerships that make equity investments, provide debt financing or support community-based tax-advantaged investments. The investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of U.S. federal and state income tax credits, including Low Income Housing Tax Credits, New Markets Tax Credits, and Historic Tax Credits. NOTE 13 SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS | (a) Acquisition of Cowen Inc. On March 1, 2023, the Bank completed the acquisition of Cowen. The acquisition advances the Wholesale Banking segment’s long-term growth strategy in the U.S. and adds complementary products and services to the Bank’s existing businesses. The results of the acquired business have been consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and primarily reported in the Wholesale Banking segment. Consideration included $1,500 million (US$1,100 million) in cash for 100% of Cowen’s common shares outstanding, $253 million (US$186 million) for the settlement of Cowen’s Series A Preferred Stock, and $205 million (US$151 million) related to the replacement of share-based payment awards. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method. The purchase price allocation can be adjusted during the measurement period, which shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances. The acquisition contributed $10,800 million (US$7,933 million) of assets and $9,884 million (US$7,261 million) of liabilities. The excess of accounting consideration over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired is allocated to other intangible assets of $298 million (US$219 million) net of taxes, and goodwill of $744 million (US$546 million). Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Since the acquisition date, the contribution of Cowen to the Bank’s revenue and net income was not significant, nor would it have been significant if the acquisition had occurred as of November 1, 2022. The Bank plans to dispose of certain non-core businesses that were acquired in connection with the Cowen acquisition. These non-core businesses are disposal groups which meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The assets and liabilities of these disposal groups are recorded in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on 192 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS",

        "chunk": "the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank disposed of a reinsurance subsidiary that was classified as held for sale. As at October 31, 2023, assets of $1,958 million and liabilities of $1,291 million were classified as held for sale. (b) T ermination of the Merger Agreement with First Horizon Corporation On May 4, 2023, the Bank and First Horizon Corporation (“First Horizon”) announced their mutual decision to terminate the pr eviously announced merger agreement for the Bank to acquire First Horizon. Under the terms of the termination agreement, the Bank made a $306 million (US$225 million) cash payment to First Horizon on May 5, 2023. The termination payment was recognized in non-interest expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and was reported in the Corporate segment. In connection with the transaction, the Bank had invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon pr eferred stock. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Bank recognized a valuation adjustment loss of $199 million (US$147 million) on this investment, recorded in OCI. On June 26, 2023, in accordance with the terms of the preferred share purchase agreement, the preferred stock converted into approximately 19.7 million common shares of First Horizon, resulting in the Bank recognizing a loss of $166 million (US$126 million) during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 in OCI based on First Horizon’s common share price at the time of conversion. Upon conversion, the losses recognized to date, including the impact of foreign exchange, were reclassified directly to retained earnings. The Bank has elected to record subsequent fair value changes on the common shares in OCI. The Bank had also implemented a strategy to mitigate the impact of inter est rate volatility to capital on closing of the acquisition. The Bank determined that the fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets | and liabilities and certain intangible assets would have been sensitive to inter est rate changes. The fair value of net assets would have determined the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles would have negatively impacted capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de- designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships. As a result of the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps wer e recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) would have mitigated the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments. Prior to the termination of the merger agreement on May 4, 2023, for the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank r eported ($1,386) million (October 31, 2022 – $1,487 million) in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $262 million (October 31, 2022 – $154 million) in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank reported $585 million (October 31, 2022 – $121 million) in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps. Following the announcement to terminate the merger agreement, the Bank discontinued this strategy and r einstated hedge accounting on the portfolio of fixed income investments using new swaps entered into at higher market rates. The impact from the higher swap rates and the basis adjustment amortization discussed above is reported in net interest income. NOTE 14 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES The recoverable amount of the Bank’s CGUs is determined from internally developed valuation models that consider various factors and assumptions such as for ecasted earnings, growth rates, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. Management is required to use judgment in estimating the recoverable amount of CGUs, and the use of different assumptions and estimates in the calculations could influence the determination of the existence of impairment and the valuation of goodwill. Management believes that the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and supportable. Where possible, assumptions generated internally are compared to relevant market information. The carrying amounts of the Bank’s CGUs are determined by management using risk-based capital models to adjust net assets and liabilities by CGU. These models consider various factors including market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, including investment capital (comprised of goodwill and other intangibles). As at the date of the last impairment test, the amount of capital not directly attributable to the CGUs and held within the Corporate segment was approximately $25.2 billion and primarily related to treasury assets and excess capital managed within the Corporate segment. The Bank’s capital oversight committees provide oversight to the Bank’s capital allocation methodologies. Key Assumptions The recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs has been determined based on its estimated value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, estimated futur e cash flows based on the Bank’s internal forecast are discounted using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. The following were the key assumptions applied in the goodwill impairment testing: Discount Rate The pre-tax discount rates used reflect current market assessments of the risks specific to each gr oup of CGUs and are dependent on the risk profile and capital requirements of each group of CGUs. Terminal Value The earnings included in the goodwill impairment testing for each operating segment wer e based on the Bank’s internal forecast, which projects expected cash flows over the next five years. Beyond the Bank’s internal forecast, cash flows were assumed to grow at a steady terminal growth rate. Terminal growth rates were based on the expected long-term growth of gross domestic product and inflation and ranged from 2.0% to 4.1% (2022 – 2.0% to 3.9%). In considering the sensitivity of the key assumptions discussed above, management determined that a r easonable change in any of the above would not result in the recoverable amount of any of the groups of CGUs to be less than their carrying amount.

Refer to Note 20 for further details. 2 Interest rate is for the period to but excluding the earliest par redemption date, and thereafter, it will be reset at a rate of three-month BA rate (as such term is defined in the applicable offering document) plus the reset spread noted. 3 On September 14, 2023, the Bank redeemed all of its outstanding $1.75 billion 3.589% medium-term notes due September 14, 2028, at a redemption price of 100 per cent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. 4 Interest rate is for the period to but excluding the earliest par redemption date, and thereafter, it will be reset at a rate of 5-year Mid-Swap Rate plus the reset spread noted. The total change in subordinated notes and debentures for the year ended October 31, 2023 primarily relates to the redemption of 3.589% medium- term notes by the Bank on September 14, 2023, foreign exchange translation and the basis adjustment for fair value hedges. NOTE 20 EQUITY | The Bank is authorized by its shareholders to issue an unlimited number of common shares, without par value, for unlimited consideration. The common shar es are not redeemable or convertible. Dividends are typically declared by the Board of Directors of the Bank on a quarterly basis and the amount may vary from quarter to quarter. Preferred Shares The Bank is authorized by its shareholders to issue, in one or more series, an unlimited number of Class A First Preferr ed Shares, without nominal or par value. Non-cumulative preferential dividends are payable either quarterly or semi-annually in accordance with applicable terms, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of the Bank. All preferred shares issued by the Bank currently include NVCC provisions, necessary for the preferred shares to qualify as regulatory capital under OSFI’s CAR guideline. NVCC provisions require the conversion of the impacted instruments into a variable number of common shares upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event. A Trigger Event is currently defined in the CAR Guideline as an event where OSFI determines that the Bank is, or is about to become, non-viable and that after conversion of all non-common capital instruments and consideration of any other relevant factors or circumstances, the viability of the Bank is expected to be restored, or where the Bank has accepted or agreed to accept a capital injection or equivalent support from a federal or provincial government of Canada without which the Bank would have been determined by OSFI to be non-viable. Limited Recourse Capital Notes The Bank has issued Limited Recourse Capital Notes (the “LRCNs”) with recourse limited to assets held in a trust consolidated by the Bank (the “Limited Recourse T rust”). The Limited Recourse Trust’s assets consist of Class A First Preferred Shares of the Bank, each series which is issued concurrently with the LRCNs (the “LRCN Preferred Shares”). The LRCN Preferred Shares are eliminated on the Bank’s consolidated financial statements. In the event of (i) non-payment of interest following any interest payment date, (ii) non-payment of the r edemption price in case of a redemption of the LRCNs, (iii) non-payment of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest at the maturity of the LRCNs, (iv) an event of default on the LRCNs, or (v) a Trigger Event, the recourse of each LRCN holder will be limited to that holder’s pro rata share of the Limited Recourse Trust’s assets. The LRCNs, by virtue of the recourse to the LRCN Preferred Shares, include standard NVCC pr ovisions necessary for them to qualify as Additional Tier 1 Capital under OSFI’s CAR guideline. NVCC provisions require the conversion of the instrument into a variable number of common shares upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event. In such an event, each LRCN Preferred Share will automatically and immediately be converted into a variable number of common shares which will be delivered to LRCN holders in satisfaction of the principal amount of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the LRCNs. The number of common shares issued will be determined based on the conversion formula set out in the terms of the respective series of LRCN Preferred Shares. 198 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS The LRCNs are compound instruments with both equity and liability features. Non-payment of interest and principal in cash does not constitute an event of default and will trigger the delivery of the LRCN Preferred Shares. The liability component has a nominal value and, therefore, the proceeds received upon issuance have been presented as equity, and any interest payments are accounted for as distributions on other equity instruments. The following table summarizes the changes to the shares and other equity instruments issued and outstanding and treasury instruments held as at and for the years ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.

Refer to “Preferred Shares and Other Equity Instruments – Significant Terms and Conditions” table for further details. 4 When the Bank purchases its own equity instruments as part of its trading business, they are classified as treasury instruments and the cost of these instruments is recorded as a reduction in equity. 199",

If converted into a series of floating rate preferred shares, the dividend rate for the quarterly period will be equal to the then 90-day Government of Canada Treasury bill yield plus the noted reset spread unless otherwise stated. 2 Subject to regulatory consent and unless otherwise stated, preferred shares are redeemable on the next earliest optional redemption date as noted and every 5 years thereafter. Preferred Shares, except Series 27 and Series 28, are convertible into the corresponding series of floating rate preferred shares on the conversion date noted and every 5 years thereafter if not redeemed. If converted, the holders have the option to convert back to the original series of preferred shares every 5 years. 3 On April 18, 2023, the Bank announced that none of its 14 million Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate Reset Preferred Shares NVCC, Series 18 (“Series 18 Shares”) would be converted on April 30, 2023 into Non-Cumulative Floating Rate Preferred Shares NVCC, Series 19 (“Series 19 Shares”). As had been previously announced on March 31, 2023, the dividend rate for the Series 18 Shares for the 5-year period from and including April 30, 2023 to but excluding April 30, 2028, if declared, is payable at a per annum rate of 5.747%. 4 LRCN Preferred Share Series 26 and Series 29 were issued at a price of $1,000 per share and LRCN Preferred Share Series 30 was issued at a price of US$1,000 per share. The LRCN Preferred Shares are eliminated on the Bank’s consolidated balance sheet. 5 LRCNs may be redeemed at the option of the Bank, with the prior written approval of OSFI, in whole or in part on prior notice by the Bank as of the earliest redemption date and each optional redemption date thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the interest rate on the LRCNs will reset on the next earliest optional redemption date and every 5 years thereafter to equal the then 5-year Government of Canada bond yield plus the noted reset spread. 6 LRCN Series 3 is denominated in U.S. dollars. The interest rate on LRCN Series 3 will reset on the next interest reset date and every 5 years thereafter to equal the then 5-year U.S. Treasury yield plus the noted reset spread. NVCC Provision If an NVCC trigger event were to occur, for all series of Class A First Preferred Shar es excluding the preferred shares issued with respect to LRCNs, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the respective series of preferred shares at the time of conversion, would be 1.0 billion in aggregate. The LRCNs, by virtue of the recourse to the preferred shares held in the Limited Recourse Trust, include NVCC provisions. For LRCNs, if an NVCC trigger wer e to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares series issued in connection with such LRCNs, would be 1.1 billion in aggregate. For NVCC subordinated notes and debentures, if an NVCC trigger event were to occur, the maximum number of common shar es that could be issued, assuming there is no accrued and unpaid interest on the respective subordinated notes and debentures, would be 2.7 billion in aggregate. The Bank is prohibited by the Bank Act (Canada) from declaring dividends on its preferred or common shar es if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the Bank is, or the payment would cause the Bank to be, in contravention of the capital adequacy and liquidity regulations of the Bank Act (Canada) or directions of OSFI. The Bank does not anticipate that this condition will restrict it from paying dividends in the normal course of business. In addition, the ability to pay dividends on common shares without the approval of the holders of the outstanding preferred shares is restricted unless all dividends on the preferred shares have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. Currently, these limitations do not restrict the payment of dividends on common shares or preferred shares. On November 29, 2023, the Board approved a dividend in an amount of one dollar and two cents ($1.02) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the Bank for the quarter ending January 31, 2024, payable on and after January 31, 2024, to shareholders of r ecord at the close of business on January 10, 2024. The Bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan for its common shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on common shares are used to pur chase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion or purchased from the open market at market price. During the year ended October 31, 2023, under the dividend reinvestment plan, the Bank issued 3.7 million common shares fr om treasury with no discount and 16.8 million common shares with a 2% discount. During the year ended October 31, 2022, under the dividend reinvestment plan, the Bank issued 2.5 million common shares from treasury with no discount and 14.5 million common shares with a 2% discount. On June 21, 2023, the Bank announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and OSFI approved the Bank’s pr eviously announced normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to repurchase for cancellation up to 30 million of its common shares (June NCIB). 200",

The following table shows the estimates of cumulative claims incurred, including IBNR, with subsequent developments during the periods and together with cumulative payments to date. The original reserve estimates are evaluated monthly for r edundancy or deficiency.

Such assumptions require a significant amount of professional judgment. The insurance claims provision is sensitive to certain assumptions. It has not been possible to quantify the sensitivity of certain assumptions such as legislative changes or uncertainty in the estimation process. Actual experience may differ from the assumptions made by the Bank. For property and casualty insurance, the main assumption underlying the claims liability estimates is that past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs. As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurr ed losses, average costs per claim, and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios. Claims liabilities estimates are based on various quantitative and qualitative factors including the discount rate, the risk adjustment, reinsurance, trends in claims severity and fr equency, and other external drivers. Qualitative and other unforeseen factors could negatively impact the Bank’s ability to accurately assess the risk of the insurance policies that the Bank underwrites. In addition, there may be significant lags between the occurr ence of an insured event and the time it is actually reported to the Bank and additional lags between the time of reporting and final settlements of claims. The following table outlines the sensitivity of the Bank’s property and casualty insurance claims liabilities to reasonably possible movements in the discount rate, the margin for adverse deviation, and the frequency and severity of claims, with all other assumptions held constant. Movements in the assumptions may be non-linear . 202 TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS Sensitivity of Critical Assumptions – Property and Casualty Insurance Contract Liabilities (millions of Canadian dollars) As at October 31, 2023 October 31, 2022 Impact on net income (loss) before income taxes Impact on equity Impact on net income (loss) before income taxes Impact on equity Impact of a 1% change in key assumptions Discount rate Increase in assumption $ 96 $ 72 $ 101 $ 75 Decrease in assumption (102) (77) (107) (79) Margin for adverse deviation Increase in assumption (44) (33) (44) (33) Decrease in assumption 44 33 44 33 Impact of a 5% change in key assumptions Frequency of claims Increase in assumption $ (58) $ (44) $ (64) $ (47) Decrease in assumption 58 44 64 47 Severity of claims Increase in assumption (219) (165) (222) (165) Decrease in assumption 219 165 222 165 For life and health insurance, the processes used to determine critical assumptions are as follows: • Mortality, morbidity, and lapse assumptions are based on industry and historical company data. • Expense assumptions are based on the annual Finance expense study. A sensitivity analysis for possible movements in the life and health insurance business assumptions was performed and the impact is not significant to the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Concentration risk is the risk resulting from large exposures to similar risks that are positively corr elated. Risk associated with automobile, residential and other products may vary in relation to the geographical ar ea of the risk insured. Exposure to concentrations of insurance risk, by type of risk, is mitigated by ceding these risks through reinsurance contracts, as well as careful selection and implementation of underwriting strategies, which is in turn largely achieved through diversification by line of business and geographical areas. For automobile insurance, legislation is in place at a provincial level and this creates differences in the benefits provided among the provinces. As at October 31, 2023, for the property and casualty insurance business, 67.3% of net written premiums wer e derived from automobile policies (October 31, 2022 – 68.1%) followed by residential with 32.4% (October 31, 2022 – 31.6%). The distribution by provinces show that business is mostly concentrated in Ontario with 50.8% of net written premiums (October 31, 2022 – 51.2%). The Western provinces represented 31.5% (October 31, 2022 – 31.7%), followed by the Atlantic provinces with 10.9% (October 31, 2022 – 10.8%), and Québec at 6.8% (October 31, 2022 – 6.3%). Concentration risk is not a major concern for the life and health insurance business as it does not have a material level of regional specific characteristics like those exhibited in the property and casualty insurance business. Reinsurance is used to limit the liability on a single claim. Concentration risk is further limited by diversification acr oss uncorrelated risks. This limits the impact of a regional pandemic and other concentration risks. To improve understanding of exposure to this risk, a pandemic scenario is tested annually. NOTE 22 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION | The Bank maintains a stock option program for certain key employees. Options on common shares are granted to eligible employees of the Bank under the plan for terms of ten years and vest over a four -year period. These options provide holders with the right to purchase common shares of the Bank at a fixed price equal to the closing market price of the shares on the TSX on the day prior to the date the options were issued. The outstanding options expire on various dates to December 12, 2032. The following table summarizes the Bank’s stock option activity and r elated information, adjusted to reflect the impact of the 2014 stock dividend on a retrospective basis, for the years ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.

Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical average daily volatility and expected dividend yield is based on dividend payouts in the last fiscal year. These assumptions are measured over a period corresponding to the option contractual life. OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The Bank operates restricted share unit and performance share unit plans which ar e offered to certain employees of the Bank. Under these plans, participants are awarded share units equivalent to the Bank’s common shares that generally vest over three years. During the vesting period, dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional share units. At the maturity date, the participant receives cash representing the value of the share units. The final number of performance share units will typically vary from 80% to 120% of the number of units outstanding at maturity (consisting of initial units awarded plus additional units in lieu of dividends) based on the Bank’s total shareholder return relative to the average of a peer group of large Canadian financial institutions. For the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank awarded 9.1 million of such share units at a weighted-average price of $88.75 (2022 – 6.9 million units at a weighted-average price of $95.07). The number of such share units outstanding under these plans as at October 31, 2023 was 25.8 million (October 31, 2022 – 21.6 million). The Bank also offers deferred share unit plans to eligible employees and non-employee dir ectors. Under these plans, a portion of the participant’s annual incentive award may be deferred, or in the case of non-employee directors, a portion of their annual compensation may be delivered as share units equivalent to the Bank’s common shares. The deferred share units are not redeemable by the participant until termination of employment or directorship. Once these conditions are met, the deferred share units must be redeemed for cash no later than the end of the next calendar year. Dividend equivalents accrue to the participants in the form of additional units. For the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank awarded 0.2 million deferred share units at a weighted-average price of $89.88 (2022 – 0.2 million units at a weighted-average price of $94.80). As at October 31, 2023, 7.0 million deferred share units were outstanding (October 31, 2022 – 6.8 million). Compensation expense for these plans is recorded in the year the incentive awar d is earned by the plan participant. Changes in the value of these plans are recorded, net of the effects of related hedges, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. For the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank recognized compensation expense for these plans of $870 million (2022 – $657 million). This expense includes losses from derivatives used to manage the volatility of share- based compensation of $337 million (2022 – $111 million gains). The carrying amount of the liability relating to these plans, based on the closing share price, was $2.4 billion at October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $2.3 billion), and is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Bank also operates a share purchase plan available to Canadian employees. Employees can contribute up to 10% of their annual eligible ear nings (net of source deductions) to the Employee Ownership Plan. For participating employees below the level of Vice President, the Bank matches 100% of the first $250 of employee contributions each year and the remainder of employee contributions at 50% to an overall maximum of 3.5% of the employee’s eligible earnings or $2,250, whichever comes first. The Bank’s contributions vest once an employee has completed two years of continuous service with the Bank. For the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank’s contributions totalled $89 million (2022 – $85 million) and were expensed as salaries and employee benefits. As at October 31, 2023, an aggregate of 24 million (October 31, 2022 – 23 million) common shares were held under the Employee Ownership Plan. The shares in the Employee Ownership Plan are purchased in the open market and are considered outstanding for computing the Bank’s basic and diluted earnings per share. Dividends earned on the Bank’s common shares held by the Employee Ownership Plan are used to purchase additional common shares for the Employee Ownership Plan in the open market. 204",

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS NOTE 23 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS The Bank sponsors a number of pension and post-retirement benefit plans for curr ent eligible and former employees. Pension arrangements include defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution pension plans and supplementary arrangements that provide pension benefits in excess of statutory limits. The Bank also provides certain post-retirement benefits. The Bank’s principal defined benefit pension plans, consisting of The Pension Fund Society of The T oronto-Dominion Bank (the “Society”) and the defined benefit portion of the TD Pension Plan (Canada) (the “TDPP DB”), are for eligible Canadian Bank employees who elected to join the Society or the TDPP DB. The Society was closed to new members on January 30, 2009, and the TDPP DB commenced on March 1, 2009. Effective December 31, 2018, the TDPP DB was closed to new employees hired after that date. All new permanent employees hired in Canada on or after January 1, 2019 are eligible to join the defined contribution portion of the TDPP (the “TDPP DC”) after one year of service. Benefits under the principal defined benefit pension plans are determined based upon the period of plan participation and the average salary of the member in the best consecutive five years in the last ten years of combined plan membership. Benefits under the TDPP DC are funded from the balance of the accumulated contributions of the member and the Bank plus the member’s investment earnings. Annual expense for the TDPP DC is equal to the Bank’s contributions to the plan. Funding for the Bank’s principal defined benefit pension plans is pr ovided by contributions from the Bank and members of the plans through a separate trust. In accordance with legislation, the Bank contributes amounts, as determined on an actuarial basis, to the plans and has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the liabilities of the plans are adequately funded over time. Any deficits determined in the funding valuations must generally be funded over a period not exceeding fi fteen years. The Bank’s funding policy is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by legislation. Any contributions in excess of the minimum requirements are discretionary. The principal defined benefit pension plans are registered with OSFI and the Canada Revenue Agency and are subject to the acts and regulations that govern federally regulated pension plans. The 2023 and 2022 contributions were made in accordance with the actuarial valuation reports for funding purposes as at October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively. Valuations for funding purposes are being prepared as of October 31, 2023 for the Society and no later than October 31, 2025 for the TDPP DB. Post-retirement defined benefit plans are unfunded and, where offered, generally include health car e and dental benefits or, to assist with the cost, a benefits subsidy to be used to reduce the cost of coverage. Employees must meet certain age and service requirements to be eligible for post- retirement benefits and are generally required to pay a portion of the cost of the benefits. Effective June 1, 2017, the Bank’s principal post-retirement defined benefit plan, covering eligible Canadian employees, was closed to new employees hired on or after that date. (a) INVESTMENT STRA TEGY AND ASSET ALLOCATION The principal defined benefit pension plans are expected to each achieve a rate of r eturn that meets or exceeds the change in value of the plan’s respective liabilities over rolling five-year periods. The investments are managed with the primary objective of providing reasonable rates of return, consistent with available market opportunities, economic conditions, consideration of plan liabilities, prudent portfolio management, and the target risk profiles for the plans. The asset allocations by asset category for the principal defined benefit pension plans ar e as follows: Plan Asset Allocation (millions of Canadian dollars except as noted) Society1 TDPP DB 1 As at October 31, 2023 Target range % of total Fair value Target range % of total Fair value Quoted Unquoted Quoted Unquoted Debt 60-90% 74% $ – $ 4,513 55-75% 72% $ – $ 2,549 Equity 0-21 4 72 153 0-30 7 79 166 Alternative investments2 0-29 22 – 1,351 5-38 21 – 734 Other3 n/a n/a – (668) n/a n/a – (729) Total 100% $ 72 $ 5,349 100% $ 79 $ 2,720 As at October 31, 2022 Debt 50-80% 67% $ – $ 4,039 55-75% 74% $ – $ 2,814 Equity 0-25 8 171 318 0-30 9 126 212 Alternative investments2 6-35 25 – 1,513 5-38 17 – 641 Other3 n/a n/a – (335) n/a n/a – (1,018) Total 100% $ 171 $ 5,535 100% $ 126 $ 2,649 1 The principal defined benefit pension plans invest in investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by the Bank. 2 The principal defined benefit pension plans’ alternative investments are primarily private equity, infrastructure, and real estate funds. 3 Consists mainly of amounts due to and due from brokers for securities traded but not yet settled, bond repurchase agreements, interest and dividends receivable, and Pension Enhancement Account assets, which are invested at the members’ discretion in certain mutual and pooled funds. | 205",

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS Public debt instruments of the Bank’s principal defined benefit pension plans must meet or exceed a credit rating of BBB- at the time of purchase. The equity portfolios of the principal defined benefit pension plans are br oadly diversified primarily across small to large capitalization quality companies with no individual holding exceeding 10% of the equity portfolio or 10% of the outstanding shares of any one company. Foreign equities are included to further diversify the portfolio. A maximum of 10% of the equity portfolio can be invested in emerging market equities. Derivatives can be utilized by the principal defined benefit pension plans provided they ar e not used to create financial leverage, unless the financial leverage is for risk management purposes. The principal defined benefit pension plans are permitted to invest in alternative investments, such as private equity, infrastructure equity, and real estate. (b) RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES The Bank’s principal defined benefit pension plans are overseen by a single retir ement governance structure established by the Human Resources Committee of the Bank’s Board of Directors. The governance structure utilizes retirement governance committees who have responsibility to oversee plan operations and investments, acting in a fiduciary capacity. Strategic, material plan changes require the approval of the Bank’s Board of Directors. The principal defined benefit pension plans’ investments include financial instruments which are exposed to various risks. These risks include market risk (including for eign currency, interest rate, inflation, equity price, and credit spread risks), credit risk, and liquidity risk. Key material risks faced by defined benefit plans are a decline in interest rates or credit spreads, which could increase the present value of the projected benefit obligation by more than the change in the value of plan assets, and from longevity risk (that is, lower mortality rates). Asset-liability matching strategies are employed to focus on obtaining an appropriate balance between ear ning an adequate return and having changes in liability values hedged by changes in asset values. The principal defined benefit pension plans manage these financial risks in accordance with the Pension Benefits Standar ds Act, 1985, applicable regulations, as well as the plans’ written investment policies. Specific risk management practices monitored for the principal defined benefit pension plans include performance, credit exposure, and asset mix. (c) OTHER SIGNIFICANT PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT Canada Trust (CT) Pension Plan As a result of the acquisition of CT Financial Services Inc., the Bank sponsors a defined benefit pension plan, which is closed to new members, but for which active members continue to accrue benefits.

Implementation of the Canada Recovery Dividend and Change in Corporate Tax Rate On December 15, 2022, Bill C-32, Fall Economic Statement Implementation Act, 2022, received Royal Assent. This bill enacted the Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD) and increased the Canadian federal tax rate for bank and life insurer groups by 1.5%. The implementation of the CRD resulted in a provision for income taxes of $553 million and a charge to OCI of $239 million, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the Canadian federal tax rate of 1.5%, prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, resulted in a provision for income taxes of $82 million and a tax benefit of $75 million in OCI related to fiscal 2022, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank also remeasured certain Canadian deferred tax assets and liabilities for the increase in tax rate, which resulted in an increase in net deferred tax assets of $50 million, which is recorded in provision for income taxes. Other Tax Matters The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), Revenu Québec Agency (RQA) and Alberta Tax and Revenue Administration (ATRA) are denying certain dividend and interest deductions claimed by the Bank. During the year ended October 31, 2023, the CRA reassessed the Bank for $15 million 210",

Restructuring – The Bank undertook certain measures in the fourth quarter of 2023 to reduce its cost base and achieve greater efficiency. In connection with these measures, the Bank incurred $363 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of 2023. The restructuring costs primarily relate to: (i) employee severance and other personnel-related costs recorded as provisions, (ii) real estate optimization mainly recorded as a reduction to land and buildings (refer to Note15), and (iii) asset impairments on internally generated software (refer to Note 14). (b) LEGAL AND REGULATOR Y MATTERS In the ordinary course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal and r egulatory actions, including but not limited to civil claims and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits, and requests for information by governmental, regulatory, and self-r egulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions, in respect of our businesses and compliance programs. The Bank establishes provisions when it becomes probable that the Bank will incur a loss and the amount can be reliably estimated. The Bank also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) in its legal and regulatory actions (that is, those which are neither probable nor remote), in excess of provisions. As at October 31, 2023, the Bank’s RPL is from zero to approximately $1.44 billion (October 31, 2022 – from zero to approximately $1.26 billion). The Bank’s provisions and RPL represent the Bank’s best estimates based upon currently available information for actions for which estimates can be made, but there are a number of factors that could cause the Bank’s provisions and/or RPL to be significantly 212",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights a significant decrease in earnings per share (EPS) compared to 2022. Basic EPS dropped from $9.48 to $5.61, and diluted EPS fell from $9.47 to $5.60. This decline is attributed to a reduction in net income attributable to common shareholders, which decreased from $17,170 million in 2022 to $10,219 million in 2023. The report also details provisions for restructuring and legal matters. In 2023, the bank recorded $363 million in restructuring charges aimed at cost reduction and efficiency improvements. Legal and regulatory provisions increased, with the bank's range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) estimated between zero and $1.44 billion, up from $1.26 billion in 2022.

For example, the Bank’s estimates involve significant judgment due to the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants in many proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, some of which are beyond the Bank’s control and/or involve novel legal theories and interpretations, the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. In addition, some actions seek very large or indeterminate damages. The Bank has been responding to formal and informal inquiries from r egulatory authorities and law enforcement concerning its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance program, both generally and in connection with specific clients, counterparties, or incidents in the U.S., including in connection with an investigation by the United States Department of Justice. The Bank is cooperating with such authorities and is pursuing efforts to enhance its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance program. While the ultimate outcomes of these inquiries and investigations are unknown at this time, the Bank anticipates monetary and/or non-monetary penalties to be imposed. In management’s opinion, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the ultimate disposition of these actions, individually or in the aggr egate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or the consolidated cash flows of the Bank. However, because of the factors listed above, as well as other uncertainties inherent in litigation and regulatory matters, there is a possibility that the ultimate resolution of legal or regulatory actions may be material to the Bank’s consolidated results of operations for any particular reporting period. Stanford Litigation – The Bank was named as a defendant in Rotstain v . Trustmark National Bank, et al., a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas related to a US$7.2 billion Ponzi scheme perpetrated by R. Allen Stanford, the owner of Stanford International Bank, Limited (SIBL), an offshore bank based in Antigua. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of investors in SIBL issued certificates of deposit. The Bank provided certain correspondent banking services to SIBL. Plaintiffs allege that the Bank and four other banks aided and abetted Mr. Stanford and that the bank defendants received fraudulent transfers from SIBL by collecting fees for providing certain services. The Official Stanford Investors Committee (OSIC), a court-approved committee r epresenting investors, received permission to intervene in the lawsuit and has brought similar claims against all the bank defendants. On November 7, 2017, the Court issued a decision denying plaintiffs’ motion to certify a class of investors in SIBL issued certificates of deposit. The court found that the plaintif fs failed to show that common issues of fact would predominate given the varying sales presentations they allegedly received. On November 1, 2019, a group of plaintiffs (comprising 1,286 investors) filed a petition in T exas state court against the Bank and other bank defendants, captioned Smith v. Independent Bank, et al., alleging claims similar to those alleged in the Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. action. On February 24, 2023, the Bank reached a settlement in principle pursuant to which the Bank has agr eed to pay US$1.205 billion to the U.S. Receiver to resolve all claims against the Bank arising from or related to Stanford, including the claims asserted in the Rotstain et al. v. Trustmark National Bank et al. and Smith et al. v. Independent Bank actions. As a result of this agreement, the Bank recorded a provision of approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax ($1.2 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, all involved parties have agreed to a bar order dismissing and releasing all current or future claims arising from or related to Stanford. On March 7, 2023, the parties finalized their settlement agreement, and on Mar ch 8, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to approve the settlement in the multi-district litigation court in the Northern District of Texas. On March 14, 2023, that Court preliminarily found that the terms of the settlement agreement are adequate, fair, reasonable, and equitable. On August 8, 2023, the Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to approve the settlement and issued the bar order. On August 22, 2023, R. Allen Stanford filed an appeal of the order appr oving the settlement. The U.S. Receiver moved to dismiss the appeal as frivolous on August 29, 2023. On September 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed the appeal. On November 7, 2023, the Supreme Court of the United States granted R. Allen Stanford’s petition to extend the time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari from December 17, 2023, to February 15, 2024. On November 8, 2023, the U.S. Receiver requested that the Supreme Court of the United States vacate the November 7, 2023, order and enter an order denying the requested extension of time. The bar order and settlement approval remain subject to further appellate review. The Bank was also a defendant in two cases filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice: (1) McDonald v . The Toronto-Dominion Bank, an action filed by the Joint Liquidators of SIBL appointed by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, and (2) Dynasty Furniture Manufacturing Ltd., et al. v. The Toronto Dominion Bank, an action filed by five investors in certificates of deposits sold by SIBL. The suits asserted that the Bank acted negligently and provided knowing assistance to SIBL’s fraud. The trial of both actions took place from January 11, 2021, to April 29, 2021. On June 8, 2021, the Superior Court rendered judgment dismissing both actions. On July 8, 2021, the Joint Liquidators filed an appeal of their action in the Court of Appeal for Ontario and the hearing of the appeal took place on April 20-21, 2022. Ther e is no appeal in the Dynasty Furniture action. On November 17, 2022, the Court of Appeal for Ontario issued a unanimous written decision which dismissed the appeal and af firmed the trial decision. On January 16, 2023, the Joint Liquidators filed an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. On July 20, 2023, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed an application for leave to appeal by the Joint Liquidators. As a result, the Canadian proceeding has now ended. Customer Class Actions – The Bank, along with several other Canadian financial institutions, is a defendant in a number of matters br ought by customers alleging provincial claims in connection with various fees, interest rate calculations, and credit decisions. The cases are in various stages of maturity. (c) COMMITMENTS Credit-related Arrangements In the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various commitments and contingent liability contracts. The primary purpose of these contracts is to make funds available for the financing needs of customers. The Bank’s policy for requiring collateral security with respect to these contracts and the types of collateral security held is generally the same as for loans made by the Bank. Financial and performance standby letters of credit represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event that a customer cannot meet its obligations to thir d parties and they carry the same credit risk, recourse, and collateral security requirements as loans extended to customers. Performance standby letters of credit are considered non- financial guarantees as payment does not depend on the occurrence of a credit event and is generally related to a non-financial trigger event. Documentary and commercial letters of credit are instruments issued on behalf of a customer authorizing a thir d party to draw drafts on the Bank up to a certain amount subject to specific terms and conditions. The Bank is at risk for any drafts drawn that are not ultimately settled by the customer, and the amounts are collateralized by the assets to which they relate. Commitments to extend credit represent unutilized portions of authorizations to extend cr edit in the form of loans and customers’ liability under acceptances. A discussion on the types of liquidity facilities the Bank provides to its securitization conduits is included in Note 10. The values of credit instruments reported as follows represent the maximum amount of additional cr edit that the Bank could be obligated to extend should contracts be fully utilized. 213",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's 2023 Annual Report highlights several key legal and regulatory challenges. The bank is involved in various legal proceedings, including a significant settlement related to the Stanford Ponzi scheme, where it agreed to pay $1.205 billion to resolve claims. This settlement was approved by the court, but further appellate review is pending. Additionally, TD Bank is addressing inquiries from regulatory authorities regarding its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance program, anticipating potential penalties. Despite these challenges, management believes these issues will not materially affect the bank's financial condition or cash flows, though they may impact specific reporting periods. The bank is also a defendant in customer class actions related to fees and credit decisions, and it continues to manage credit-related commitments and contingent liabilities in its normal business operations."

In addition, as at October 31, 2023, the Bank is committed to fund $554 million (October 31, 2022 – $502 million) of private equity investments. Long-term Commitments or Leases The Bank has obligations under long-term non-cancellable leases for premises and equipment. The maturity profile for undiscounted lease liabilities is $45 million for 2024, $102 million for 2025, $191 million for 2026, $364 million for 2027, $347 million for 2028, $5,871 million for 2029 and thereafter.

(d) ASSETS SOLD WITH RECOURSE In connection with its securitization activities, the Bank typically makes customary representations and warranties about the underlying assets which may result in an obligation to repurchase the assets. These representations and warranties attest that the Bank, as the seller, has executed the sale of assets in good faith, and in compliance with relevant laws and contractual requirements. In the event that they do not meet these criteria, the loans may be required to be repurchased by the Bank. (e) GUARANTEES In addition to financial and performance standby letters of credit, the following types of transactions represent the principal guarantees that the Bank has entered into. Credit Enhancements The Bank guarantees payments to counterparties in the event that third- party credit enhancements supporting asset pools are insufficient. Indemnification Agreements In the normal course of operations, the Bank provides indemnification agreements to various counterparties in transactions such as service agreements, leasing transactions, and agreements relating to acquisitions and dispositions. Under these agreements, the Bank is required to compensate counterparties for costs incurred as a result of various contingencies such as changes in laws and regulations and litigation claims. The nature of certain indemnification agreements prevent the Bank from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount that the Bank would be required to pay such counterparties. The Bank also indemnifies directors, officers, and other persons, to the extent permitted by law, against certain claims that may be made against them as a result of their services to the Bank or, at the Bank’s request, to another entity. (f) PLEDGED ASSETS AND COLLATERAL In the ordinary course of business, securities and other assets are pledged against liabilities or contingent liabilities, including repurchase agreements, securitization liabilities, covered bonds, obligations related to securities sold short, and securities borrowing transactions. Assets are also deposited for the purposes of participation in clearing and payment systems and depositories or to have access to the facilities of central banks in foreign jurisdictions, or as security for contract settlements with derivative exchanges or other derivative counterparties.

NOTE 27 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS | Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to directly or indirectly control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial or operational decisions. The Bank’s related parties include key management personnel, their close family members and their related entities, subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, and post- employment benefit plans for the Bank’s employees. TRANSACTIONS WITH KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, THEIR CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS, AND THEIR RELATED ENTITIES Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing, and controlling the activities of the Bank, directly or indirectly. The Bank considers certain of its officers and directors to be key management personnel. The Bank makes loans to its key management personnel, their close family members, and their related entities on market terms and conditions with the exception of banking products and services for key management personnel, which are subject to approved policy guidelines that govern all employees. 214",

There were no significant transactions between the Bank, Schwab, and Symcor during the year ended October 31, 2023, other than as described in the following sections and in Note 12. i) TRANSACTIONS WITH SCHW AB A description of significant transactions between the Bank and its affiliates with Schwab is set forth below . Insured Deposit Account Agreement On November 25, 2019, the Bank and Schwab signed the 2019 Schwab IDA Agr eement, with an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. Under the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into the 2023 Schwab IDA Agr eement, which replaced the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement. Pursuant to the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank continues to make sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Schwab designates a portion of the deposits with the Bank as FROA. Remaining deposits over the minimum level of FROA are designated as floating-rate obligations. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by three years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until September 2025, the aggregate FROA will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to $6.8 billion (US$5 billion) of FROA by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to certain limits. During the year ended October 31, 2023, Schwab exercised its option to buy down $6.1 billion (US$4.5 billion) of FROA and paid $305 million (US$227 million) in termination fees to the Bank in accor dance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement. The fees are intended to compensate the Bank for losses incurred this year from discontinuing certain hedging relationships, as well as for lost revenues. The net impact is recorded in net interest income. As at October 31, 2023, deposits under the Schwab IDA Agreement wer e $133 billion (US$96 billion) (October 31, 2022 – $174 billion (US$128 billion)). The Bank paid fees, net of the termination fees received from Schwab, of $932 million during the year ended October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $1.7 billion) to Schwab related to sweep deposit accounts. The amount paid by the Bank is based on the average insured deposit balance of $147 billion for the year ended October 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $182 billion) and yields based on agreed upon market benchmarks, less the actual interest paid to clients of Schwab. As at October 31, 2023, amounts receivable from Schwab were $38 million (October 31, 2022 – $31 million). As at October 31, 2023, amounts payable to Schwab wer e $24 million (October 31, 2022 – $152 million). ii) TRANSACTIONS WITH SYMCOR The Bank has one-third ownership in Symcor, a Canadian provider of business pr ocess outsourcing services offering a diverse portfolio of integrated solutions in item processing, statement processing and production, and cash management services. The Bank accounts for Symcor’s results using the equity method of accounting. During the year ended October 31, 2023, the Bank paid $81 million (October 31, 2022 – $77 million) for these services. As at October 31, 2023, the amount payable to Symcor was $12 million (October 31, 2022 – $12 million). The Bank and two other shareholder banks have also provided a $100 million unsecur ed loan facility to Symcor which was undrawn as at October 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022. NOTE 28 SEGMENTED INFORMATION | For management reporting purposes, the Bank reports its results under four key business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS funds transfer pricing, inter-segment revenue, income tax rates, capital, indirect expenses and cost transfers to measure business segment results. The basis of allocation and methodologies are reviewed periodically to align with management’s evaluation of the Bank’s business segments. Transfer pricing of funds is generally applied at market rates. Intersegment revenue is negotiated between each business segment and approximates the fair value of the services provided. Income tax provision or r ecovery is generally applied to each segment based on a statutory tax rate and may be adjusted for items and activities unique to each segment. Amortization of intangibles acquired as a result of business combinations is included in the Corporate segment. Accordingly, net income for business segments is presented before amortization of these intangibles. Non-interest income is earned by the Bank primarily through investment and securities services, credit fees, trading income, service charges, card services, and insurance revenues. Revenues from investment and securities services are earned predominantly in the Wealth Management and Insurance segment. Revenues from credit fees are primarily earned in the Wholesale Banking and Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segments. Trading income is earned within Wholesale Banking. Both service charges and card services revenue are mainly earned in the U.S. Retail and Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segments. Insurance revenue is earned in the Wealth Management and Insurance segment. Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or tax- exempt income, primarily dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net inter est income with similar institutions. The TEB adjustment reflected in Wholesale Banking is reversed in the Corporate segment. The following table summarizes the segment results for the years ended October 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS NOTE 31 REGULATORY CAPITAL | The Bank manages its capital under guidelines established by OSFI. The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to credit, trading market, and operational risks. The Bank has various capital policies, procedures, and controls which it utilizes to achieve its goals and objectives. The Bank’s capital management objectives are: • To be an appropriately capitalized financial institution as determined by: – the Bank’s Risk Appetite Statement; – capital requirements defined by relevant regulatory authorities; and – the Bank’s internal assessment of capital requirements, including stress test analysis, consistent with the Bank’s risk profile and risk tolerance levels. • To have the most economic weighted-average cost of capital achievable, while preserving the appropriate mix of capital elements to meet targeted capitalization levels. • To ensure ready access to sources of appropriate capital, at reasonable cost, in order to: – insulate the Bank from unexpected loss events; and – support and facilitate business growth and/or acquisitions consistent with the Bank’s strategy and risk appetite. • To support strong external debt ratings, in order to manage the Bank’s overall cost of funds and to maintain access to required funding. These objectives are applied in a manner consistent with the Bank’s overall objective of providing a satisfactory return on shareholders’ equity. Basel III Capital Framework Capital requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are commonly referred to as Basel III. Under Basel III, Total Capital consists of three components, namely Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III also implemented a non-risk sensitive leverage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The objective of the leverage ratio is to constrain the build-up of excess leverage in the banking sector. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage exposure which is primarily comprised of on- balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. Capital Position and Capital Ratios The Basel framework allows qualifying banks to determine capital levels consistent with the way they measure, manage, and mitigate risks. It specifies methodologies for the measurement of credit, trading market, and operational risks. The Bank uses the Internal Ratings-Based approaches to credit risk for all material portfolios. For accounting purposes, IFRS is followed for consolidation of subsidiaries and joint ventures. For regulatory capital purposes, all subsidiaries of the Bank are consolidated except for insurance subsidiaries which are deconsolidated and follow prescribed treatment per OSFI’s CAR guidelines. Insurance subsidiaries are subject to their own capital adequacy reporting, such as OSFI’s Minimum Capital Test for General Insurance and Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test for Life and Health. Some of the Bank’s subsidiaries are individually regulated by either OSFI or other regulators. Many of these entities have minimum capital requirements which may limit the Bank’s ability to extract capital or funds for other uses. Canadian banks designated as domestic systemically important bank (D-SIBs) are required to comply with OSFI’s minimum targets for risk-based and leverage ratios. The minimum targets include a D-SIB surcharge and Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) for CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital and risk-based Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) ratios. The DSB level was increased to 3% as of February 1, 2023, which sets these minimum target ratios at 11%, 12.5%, 14.5% and 24.5%, respectively. Also on February 1, 2023, OSFI announced revisions to the Leverage Requirements Guideline to introduce a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the existing minimum requirement. This sets the minimum targets for leverage and TLAC leverage ratios at 3.5% and 7.25%, respectively. OSFI announced that the DSB level will be set at 3.5%, effective November 1, 2023.

Intercompany transactions may be included herein which are eliminated for consolidated financial reporting purposes. Certain of the Bank’s subsidiaries have regulatory requirements to fulfil, in accordance with applicable law, in order to transfer funds, including paying dividends to, repaying loans to, or redeeming subordinated debentures issued to, the Bank. These customary requirements include, but are not limited to: • Local regulatory capital and/or surplus adequacy requirements; • Basel requirements under Pillar 1 and Pillar 2; • Local regulatory approval requirements; and • Local corporate and/or securities laws. As at October 31, 2023, the net assets of subsidiaries subject to regulatory or CAR was approximately $103 billion (October 31, 2022 – $97 billion), before intercompany eliminations. In addition to regulatory requirements outlined above, the Bank may be subject to significant restrictions on its ability to use the assets or settle the liabilities of members of its group. Key contractual restrictions may arise from the provision of collateral to third parties in the normal course of business, for example through secured financing transactions; assets securitized which are not subsequently available for transfer by the Bank; and assets transferred into other consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities. The impact of these restrictions has been disclosed in Notes 9 and 26. NOTE 33 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On November 16, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced a final rule that implements a special assessment to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors during the U.S. bank failures in Spring 2023 (the “Special Assessment”). The Special Assessment is expected to result in the recognition of a provision of approximately US$300 million pre-tax in the first quarter of the Bank’s fiscal 2024. | 221",

A subsequent event is noted where the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced a special assessment to recover losses from U.S. bank failures, which will result in a provision of approximately US$300 million pre-tax in the first quarter of fiscal 2024."
