        "page_content": "- - TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 6 SIGNIFICANT AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, AND PENDING ACQUISITIONS Acquisition of Cowen Inc. On March 1, 2023, the Bank completed the acquisition of Cowen Inc. (“Cowen”). The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and primarily reported in the Wholesale Banking segment. Pending Acquisition of First Horizon Corporation On February 28, 2022, the Bank and First Horizon Corporation (“First Horizon”) announced a definitive agreement for the Bank to acquire First Horizon in an all cash transaction valued at US$13.4 billion, or US$25.00 for each common share of First Horizon. In connection with this transaction, the Bank has invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock (convertible in certain circumstances into up to 4.9% of First Horizon’s common stock). First Horizon shareholders will receive, at closing, an additional US$0.65 per share on an annualized basis for the period from November 27, 2022 through the day immediately prior to the closing. On February 9, 2023, the parties announced they had mutually agreed to extend the outside date to May 27, 2023, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities, which now are not expected to be obtained prior to May 27, 2023. Regulatory approvals are not within the Bank’s control. If the merger does not close by May 27, 2023, then an amendment to the merger agreement would be required to further extend the outside date. TD and First Horizon are discussing a potential further extension. The Bank has implemented a strategy to mitigate the impact of interest rate volatility to capital on closing of the acquisition. The fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets are sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets will determine the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles will negatively impact capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships. Since the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps are recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) will mitigate the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments. For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank reported ($998) million in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $122 million in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank reported $251 million in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps. Based on the estimated financial performance and balance sheets of the Bank and First Horizon, including transaction-related impacts, the Bank expects that its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio will be comfortably above 11% upon the closing of the First Horizon acquisition. Implementation of the Canada Recovery Dividend and Change in Corporate Tax Rate On December 15, 2022, Bill C-32, Fall Economic Statement Implementation Act, 2022, received Royal Assent. This bill enacted the Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD) and increased the Canadian federal tax rate for bank and life insurer groups by 1.5%. The implementation of the CRD resulted in a provision for income taxes of $553 million and a charge to other comprehensive income of $239 million, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the Canadian federal tax rate of 1.5%, prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, resulted in a provision for income taxes of $82 million and a tax benefit of $75 million in other comprehensive income related to fiscal 2022, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank also remeasured certain Canadian deferred tax assets and liabilities for the increase in tax rate, which resulted in an increase in net deferred tax assets of $50 million, which is recorded in provision for income taxes. Stanford Litigation Settlement On February 24, 2023, the Bank reached a settlement in principle (the “settlement” or “agreement”) relating to litigation involving the Stanford Financial Group (the “Stanford litigation”). Once the settlement is approved by the Court, the Bank will pay US$1.205 billion to the court-appointed receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate. Under the terms of the agreement, TD has settled with the receiver, the Official Stanford Investors Committee, and other plaintiffs in the litigation and these parties have agreed to release and dismiss all current or future claims arising from or related to the Stanford matter. As a result of this agreement, the Bank recorded a provision of approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax ($1.2 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023."

Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP r atios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings per s hare (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the Bank’s performance. Non- GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be compar able to similar terms used by other issuers. Supplementary financial measures depict the Bank’s financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the Bank’s capital position, and both are explained in this document where they first appear.

Non-Interest Expenses and Efficiency Ratio Quarterly comparison – Q1 2023 vs. Q1 2022 Reported non-interest expenses were $8,316 million, an increase of $2,349 million, or 39%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting the Stanford litigation settlement, higher employee-related expenses, the impact of foreign exchange translation, higher acquisition and integration-related charges, and higher spend supporting business growth. Adjusted non-interest expenses were $6,541 million, an increase of $644 million, or 11%, compared with the first quarter last year. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects an increase in the Corporate segment of $1,580 million, an increase in U.S. Retail of $474 million, an increase in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $174 million, an increase in Wholesale Banking of $119 million, and an increase in Wealth Management and Insurance of $2 million. The Bank’s reported efficiency ratio was 68.0% compared to 52.9% in the first quarter last year. The Bank’s adjusted efficiency ratio was 49.9%, compared with 52.3% in the first quarter last year. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2023 vs. Q4 2022 Reported non-interest expenses for the quarter increased $1,771 million, or 27%, compared with the prior quarter reflecting the Stanford litigation settlement, higher employee-related expenses, partially offset by lower professional and advisory spend. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased $111 million, or 2%, compared with the prior quarter. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects an increase in the Corporate segment of $1,679 million, an increase in U.S. Retail of $95 million, an increase in Wholesale Banking of $81 million, partially offset by a decrease in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $58 million, and a decrease in Wealth Management and Insurance of $26 million. The Bank’s reported efficiency ratio was 68.0% compared with 42.1% in the prior quarter. The Bank’s adjusted efficiency ratio was 49.9%, compared with 52.5% in the prior quarter. Income Taxes As discussed in “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in the “How We Performed” section of this document, the Bank adjusts its reported results to assess each of its businesses and to measure overall Bank performance. As such, the provision for income taxes is stated on a reported and an adjusted basis. The Bank’s effective income tax rate on a reported basis was 42.2% for the current quarter, compared with 21.9% in the first quarter last year and 16.9% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the tax adjustments associated with the implementation of the CRD and the 1.5% Canadian federal tax rate increase, partially offset by the remeasurement of certain Canadian deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from the tax rate increase and favourable earnings mix. The quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflects tax adjustments associated with the CRD and the tax rate increase, as well as favourable items in the prior quarter, partially offset by the remeasurement of certain Canadian deferred tax assets and liabilities. To allow for an after-tax calculation of adjusted income, the adjusted provision for income taxes is calculated by adjusting the taxes for each item of note using the statutory income tax rate of the applicable legal entity. The adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes before other taxes as a percentage of adjusted net income before taxes. The Bank’s adjusted effective income tax rate was 21.8% for the current quarter, compared with 22.0% in the first quarter last year and 16.7% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects favourable earnings mix, partially offset by the 1.5% Canadian federal tax rate increase related to fiscal 2023 income. The quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflects favourable items in the prior quarter. Adjusted results are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers.

        "page_content": "TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 13 The global economy remains on track to slow in calendar 2023, but to a lesser degree than previously expected. Europe’s economy has avoided the worst-case scenario on its energy crisis and the sudden end of zero-COVID policies in China is expected to provide an earlier lift to its economic prospects. In North America, COVID-19 is no longer factoring into the economic outlook, but its legacy of high domestic inflation and tight labour markets has led central banks to raise policy rates at the fastest pace in roughly four decades. The impact of this dramatic increase is expected to be the primary influence dampening the economic outlook in 2023. The U.S. economy expanded by 2.7% annualized in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022. However, headline growth was boosted by temporary factors. In contrast, underlying domestic demand grew by a more modest 0.7% annualized, as the ongoing downturn in the housing market weighed on the economy. Consumer spending growth remained resilient, advancing 1.4% annualized, as a strong labour market continued to support income growth. Higher interest rates are expected to continue to weigh on economic growth in 2023, and lead to eventual cooling in the job market. As of January, the unemployment rate was 3.4%, the lowest level in over 50 years. Inflation has shown signs of cooling, particularly for consumer goods. However, services inflation has been more persistent. Measures of underlying services inflation continue to run well above the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Inflation has kept the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy, but at a more measured pace as it weighs the cumulative effect of 450 basis points (bps) of hikes over the past year. TD Economics expects interest rate hikes of 25 bps to occur at the March and May meetings, taking the Federal Funds rate to a range of 5.00-5.25%. Continued strength in the labour market and inflation may lead to further interest rate increases thereafter, as the Federal Reserve monitors the incoming economic and financial data between meetings. Given the large increase in interest rates over the past year, the risk of a recession remains elevated. The Canadian economy has begun to slow after growing at a very healthy pace in the first half of calendar 2022. The housing market has continued to weaken, due to higher borrowing costs, and the downturn is weighing on economic growth. Canadian inflation has also begun to cool, although the labour market remains quite strong with the unemployment rate at 5.0% in January 2023. With the aggregate spending of households and businesses expected to stagnate in the coming quarters, TD Economics expects job market conditions to ease. Given the weak growth backdrop and uncertainty surrounding the impact of past interest rate hikes on highly indebted Canadian households, the risk of recession also remains elevated in Canada. The Bank of Canada raised its overnight interest rate by 25 bps in January, to 4.50%. It signalled an intention to pause its rate-hike cycle provided the economy and inflation continue to slow in line with its outlook. The Canadian dollar is expected to hover around the mid-70 U.S. cent range in calendar 2023. For management reporting purposes, the Bank’s operations and activities are organized around the following four key business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The Bank’s other activities are grouped into the Corporate segment. Results of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the Bank measures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments, the Bank indicates that the measure is adjusted. For further details, refer to the “How We Performed” section of this document, the “Business Focus” section in the Bank’s 2022 MD&A, and Note 29 of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2022. PCL related to performing (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and impaired (Stage 3) financial assets, loan commitments, and financial guarantees is recorded within the respective segment. Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt income, including certain dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking results is reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the quarter was $57 million, compared with $36 million in the prior quarter and $38 million in the first quarter last year. Share of net income from investment in Schwab is reported in the U.S. Retail segment. Amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction are recorded in the Corporate segment."

The impact of foreign exchange translation from the appreciation in the Canadian dollar decreased total assets by $22 billion, or approximately 1%. The increase in total assets reflects trading loans, securities, and other of $10 billion, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements of $10 billion, loans, net of allowances for loan losses of $6 billion, other assets of $6 billion, cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $5 billion, and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) of $2 billion.

Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss increased $23 billion primarily reflecting new issuances, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Deposits decreased $9 billion as the increase in total deposits volume was more than offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $13 billion reflecting an increase in volume, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Other liabilities increased $1 billion primarily reflecting increase in provision for the Stanford litigation settlement. Equity was $112 billion as at January 31, 2023, an increase of $1 billion from October 31, 2022. The increase primarily reflects issuances of common shares. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2023 vs. Q1 2022 Gross impaired loans excluding acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans were $2,591 million as at January 31, 2023, an increase of $31 million, or 1%, compared with the first quarter last year. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking gross impaired loans increased $131 million, or 14%, compared with the first quarter last year, largely reflecting formations outpacing resolutions in the commercial lending portfolio. U.S. Retail gross impaired loans decreased $140 million, or 9%, compared with the first quarter last year as reductions in the real estate secured lending and commercial lending portfolios were partially offset by some normalization in the credit card portfolio. Wholesale gross impaired loans increased $40 million, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting a few new formations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net impaired loans were $1,764 million as at January 31, 2023, a decrease of $116 million, or 6%, compared with the first quarter last year. The allowance for credit losses of $7,479 million as at January 31, 2023 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $832 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,620 million and Stage 1 allowance of $3,025 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $2 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $146 million, or 21%, reflecting some normalization of credit performance. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses increased $190 million, or 3%. The allowance change included an increase of $74 million attributable to the retailer program partners’ share of the U.S. strategic cards portfolio. The allowance for debt securities decreased by $5 million compared with the first quarter last year. Forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables deemed to be predictive of expected credit losses (ECLs) based on the Bank’s experience, is used to determine ECL scenarios and associated probability weights to determine the probability-weighted ECLs. Each quarter, all base forecast macroeconomic variables are refreshed, resulting in new upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios. The probability weightings assigned to each ECL scenario are also reviewed each quarter and updated as required, as part of the Bank’s ECL governance process. As a result of periodic reviews and quarterly updates, the allowance for credit losses may be revised to reflect updates in loss estimates based on the Bank’s recent loss experience and its forward-looking views. The Bank periodically reviews the methodology and has performed certain additional quantitative and qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s first quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on forward-looking information. The probability-weighted allowance for credit losses reflects the Bank’s forward-looking views. To the extent that certain anticipated effects cannot be fully incorporated into quantitative models, management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in determining the amount of ECLs. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and the allowance for credit losses will be updated in future quarters as additional information becomes available. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s first quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Bank calculates allowances for ECLs on debt securities measured at amortized cost and FVOCI. The Bank has $405 billion in such debt securities, all of which are performing (Stage 1 and 2) and none are impaired (Stage 3). The allowance for credit losses on DSAC and debt securities at FVOCI was $1 million and $1 million, respectively. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2023 vs. Q4 2022 Gross impaired loans excluding ACI loans increased $88 million, or 4%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting a new formation in the health and social services sector in the Canadian commercial lending portfolio, and some further normalization of credit performance in the consumer lending portfolios, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. Impaired loans net of allowance increased $18 million, or 1%, compared with the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses of $7,479 million as at January 31, 2023 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $832 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,620 million and Stage 1 allowance of $3,025 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $2 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $68 million, or 9%, compared with the prior quarter, related to some further normalization of credit performance, largely reflected in the consumer lending portfolios. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses increased $46 million, or 1%, as increases related to volume growth and credit conditions were largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The allowance for debt securities decreased by $1 million compared to the prior quarter. For further details on loans, impaired loans, allowance for credit losses, and on the Bank’s use of forward-looking information and macroeconomic variables in determining its allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 6 of the Bank’s first quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements."

Re al Estate Secured Lending etail real estate secured lending includes mortgages and lines of credit to North American consumers to satisfy financing needs including home purchases and refi nancing. While the Bank retains first lien on the majority of properties held as security, there is a small portion of loans with second liens, but most of these are behind a TD mortgage that is in first position. In Canada, credit policies are designed so that the combined exposure of all uninsured facilities on one property does not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination. Lending at a higher loan-to-value ratio is permitted by legislation but r equires default insurance. This insurance is contractual coverage for the life of eligible facilities and protects the Bank’s real estate secured lending portfo lio against potential losses caused by borrowers’ default. The Bank may also purchase default insurance on lower loan-to-value ratio loans. The insurance is provided by either government-backed enti ties or approved private mortgage insurers. In the U.S., for residential mortgage originations, mortgage insurance is usuall y obtained from either government backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers when the loan-to-value exceeds 80% of the collateral value at origination. he Bank regularly performs stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio as part of its overall stress testing program. This is done with a view to determine the extent to which the portfolio would be vulnerable to a severe downturn in economic conditions. The effect of severe changes in house prices, interest rates, and unemployment levels are among the factors considered when assessing the impact on credit losses and the Bank’s overall profitability. A variety of portfolio segm ents, including dwelling type and geographical regions, are examined during the exercise to determine whether specific vulnerabilities exist.

The most recent customer payment amount may exceed the original contractual amount due. Balan ces with a remaining amortization longer than 30 years primarily reflect Canadian variable rate mortgages where interest rate increases relative to current customer payment levels have resulted in a longer current amortization period. At renewal, the amortization period for Canadian mort gages reverts to the remaining contractual amortization, which may require increased payments.

Under Basel III, To tal Capital consists of three components, namely CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III intr oduced a non-risk sensitive leverage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage exposure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. TD manages its regulatory capital in accordance with the Basel III Capital Framewo rk as discussed in the “Capital Position” section of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III SFI’s Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guideline details how the Basel III capital rules apply to Canadian banks. For more information refer to “OSFI’s apital Requirements under Basel III” section of Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. he table below summarizes OSFI’s current regulatory minimum risk sensitive capital and TLAC ratios for the Bank as at January 31 , 2023.

The D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the Bank’s 1% G-SIB additional common equity requirement. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%. 2 The Ba nk’s countercyclical buffer requirement is 0% as of January 31, 2023. 3 Domestic Stability Buffer. The Bank’s Leverage Ratio is calculated as per OSFI’s Leverage Requirements guideline and has a regulatory minimum requirement of 3%, and the Bank is r equired to meet a supervisory TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75%. In fiscal 2020, OSFI introduced a number of measures to support D-SIBs’ ability to supply credit to the economy during an expected period of disruption related to COVID-19 and market conditions. These measures, and subsequent guidance issued by OSFI, are described in the “OSFI’s Capital Requirements under asel III” section of Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. Global Systemically Important Banks Disclosures The Financial Stability Board (FSB), in consultation with the BCBS and national authorities, identifies G-SIBs. In July 2013, the BCBS issued an update to the final rul es on G-SIBs and outlined the G-SIB assessment methodology which is based on the submissions of the largest global banks. In J uly 2018, BCBS issued a revised G-SIB framework; G-SIBs: Revised Assessment Methodology and the Higher Loss Absorbency Requirement. The new assessment methodology introduces a trading volume indicator and modifies the weights in the substitutability category, amends the definition of cross-j urisdictional indicators, extends the scope of consolidation to insurance subsidiaries, and provides further guidance on bucket migration and associated loss absorbency surcharges. The revised methodology came into effect in 2022, using 2021 year-end data."

        "page_content": "Page 26 he thirteen indicators are used in the G-SIB assessment methodology to determine systemic importance. The score for a particula r indicator is calculated by dividing the individual bank value by the aggregate amount for the indicator summed across all banks included in the assessment. Accordingly, an individual bank’s ranking is reliant on the results and submissions of other global banks. he Bank is required to publish the thirteen indicators used in the G-SIB indicator-based assessment framework. Public disclosure of financial year-end data is req uired annually, no later than the date of a bank’s first quarter public disclosure of shareholder financial data in the following year. The public communications on G-SIB status are issued annually each November. On November 22, 2019, the Bank was designated as a G-SIB by the FSB. he Bank continued to maintain its G-SIB status when the FSB published the 2021 list of G-SIBs on November 23, 2021. As a result of this designation, the Bank is subject to an additional loss absorbency requirement (CET1 as a percentage of RWA) of 1% under applicable FSB member authority requirements; however, in accordance with OSFI’s CAR guideline, for Canadian banks designated as a G-SIB, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will ap ply. As the D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the incremental 1% G-SIB common equity ratio requirement, the Bank’s G-SIB designation has no additional impact on the Bank’s minimum CET1 regulatory requirements. There is also currently no impact to the supervisory target risk-based TLAC ratio of 24.0% or TLAC leverage ratio of 6.75% as a result of the Bank’s G SIB requirements. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%. As a result of the Bank’s G-SIB designation, the U.S. Federal Reserve requires TD Group US Holding LLC (TDGUS), as TD’s U.S. Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC and long-term debt. he indicator-based measurement approach, currently in effect, divides the thirteen indicators into five categories, with each c ategory yielding a 20% weight to a bank’s total score on the G-SIB scale. he following table provides the results of the thirteen indicators for the Bank. The increase in Intra-financial system assets w as primarily due to deposits with other financial institutions and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives with other financial institutions. Securities outstanding increased due to certificates of deposit, debt sec urities and commercial paper. The increase in OTC derivatives reflects increased interest rate swaps. The decrease in Trading and other securities reflects a decrease in trading securities and securities at FVOCI. Other notable changes in the indicators from prior year primarily reflect normal business activities of the ank. TABLE 25: G-SIB INDICATORS1,2 1 The G- SIB indicators are prepared based on the methodology prescribed in BCBS guidelines published and disclosed in accordance wit h OSFI’s Advisory on G-SIBs – Public Disclosure Requirements. Given the Bank was designated as a G-SIB by the FSB on November 22, 2019, additional public disclosures on these indicators are required. Refer to the Bank’s Regulatory Capital Disclosures at w ww.td.com/investor-relations/ir-homepage/regulatory-disclosures/g-sib/disclosures.jsp for t hese additional disclosures on the 2022 G-SIB indicators. The Ba nk is required to submit its G-SIB indicators to OSFI and BCBS for review following the date of this report. In the event that one or both regulators provide comments to the Bank regarding its submission that would result in changes to the G-SIB indicators listed in the table above, the Bank will publish s uch revised G-SIB indicators on its website. 2 The Cross-jurisdictional activity indicators for October 31, 2021 have been revised.

The decrease in the Bank’s CET1 Capital ratio comp ared to October 31, 2022 was attributable primarily to RWA growth across various segments, the impacts of the Stanford litig ation settlement, CRD, and mark-to -market losses on swaps de-designated from hedge accounting relationships to mitigate the impacts of interest rate volatility to closing capital of the First Ho rizon acquisition and foreign exchange rate, and the elimination of the scaling factor related to OSFI’s transition arrangements for ECL provisioning.

The decrease in the Bank’s Leverage ratio from 4.9% as at October 31 , 2022 was attributable prima rily to increased leverage exposures across various segments, offset by organic capital growth. Future Regulatory Capital Developments uture regulatory capital developments, in addition to those described in the “Future Regulatory Capital Developments” section of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report, are noted below. n December 8, 2022, OSFI announced that the DSB level will be set at 3% as of February 1, 2023. The 50 bps increase from the pr evious level of 2.5% reflects OSFI’s assessment that systemic vulnerabilities remain elevated. In addition, OSFI has increased the DSB’s range from 0 to 4%, i nstead of the previous 0 to 2.5% to allow the DSB to remain responsive to an uncertain environment. n January 31, 2022, OSFI announced revised capital, leverage, liquidity and disclosure rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. The Leverage Requirements Guideline revisions include a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the regulatory minimum requirement of 3.0%. This buffer will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio supervisory target of 6.75%. The revised rul es are effective February 1, 2023, with the exception of those related to market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk which are effective November 1, 2023.

Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on commo n shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average mark et price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion or purchased from the open market at market price. The Bank had determined that, beginning with the dividend approved on May 25, 20 22 for the quarter ending July 31, 2022, and until further announcement, the Bank will issue the common shares from treasury and will apply a 2% discount to the average market price on such common shares. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank issued 7.9 million common shares from treasury with a 2% discount.

The Bank’s goal is to earn a stable and sustainable rate of return for every dollar of risk it takes, while putting significant emphasis on investing in its businesses to meet its future strategic objectives. The Bank’s businesses and operations are exposed to a broad number of risks that have been identified and defined in the Enterpri se Risk Framework. The ank’s tolerance to those risks is defined in the Enterprise Risk Appetite which has been developed within a comprehensive framework that takes into c onsideration current conditions in which the Bank operates and the impact that emerging risks will have on TD’s strategy and ris k profile. The Bank’s risk appetite states that it takes risks required to build its business, but only if those risks: (1) fit the business strategy and can be understood and managed; (2) do not expose the enterprise to any significant single loss events; TD does not ‘bet the bank’ on any single acquisition, business, or product; and (3) do not risk harming the TD brand. Each business is responsible for setting and aligning its individual risk appetites with that of the enterprise based on a thorough examination of the specific risks to which it is exposed. The Bank considers it critical to regularly assess its operating environment and highlight top and emerging risks. These are ris ks with a potential to have a mater ial effect on the Bank and where the attention of senior leaders is focused due to the potential magnitude or immediacy of th eir impact. Risks are identified, discussed, and actioned by senior leaders and reported quarterly to the Risk Committee. Specific plans to mitigate top and emerging risks are prepared, monitored, and adjusted as required. he Bank’s risk governance structure and risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. Additional information on risk factors can be found in this document and the 2022 MD&A under the heading “Risk Factors and Management”. For a complete discussion of the risk governance structure and the risk management approach, refer to the “Managing Risk” section in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. The shaded sections of this MD&A represent a discussion relating to market and liquidity risks and form an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended January 31, 2023. Gross credit risk exposure, also referred to as exposure at default (EAD), is the total amount the Bank is exposed to at the time of default of a loan and is measured before counterparty-specific provisions or write-offs. Gross credit risk exposure does not reflect the effects of credit risk mitigation (CRM) and includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. On-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of outstanding loans, accept ances, n on-trading securities, derivatives, and certain other repo-style transactions. Off-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of undrawn commitments, gua rantees, and certain other repo-style transactions. ross credit risk exposures for the two approaches the Bank uses to measure credit risk are included in the following table.

        "page_content": "3 1 Calculating VaR The Bank computes total VaR on a daily basis by combining the General Market Risk (GMR) and Idiosyncratic Debt Specific Risk (IDSR) associated with the Bank’s trading positions. GMR is determined by creating a distribution of potential changes in the market value of the current portfolio using historical si mulation. The Bank values the current portfolio using the market price and rate changes of the most recent 259 trading days for equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity products. GMR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. A one-day holding period is used for GMR calculation, which is scaled up to ten days for regulatory capital calculation purposes. IDSR measures idiosyncratic (single-name) credit spread risk for credit exposures in the trading portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. The IDSR model is based on the historical behaviour of five-year idiosyncratic credit spreads. Similar to GMR, IDSR is computed as the threshold l evel that portfolio losses are not exp ected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. IDSR is measured for a ten-day holding period. he following graph discloses daily one-day VaR usage and trading net revenue, reported on a TEB, within Wholesale Banking. Tradi ng net revenue includes tra ding income and net interest income related to positions within the Bank’s market risk capital trading books. For the quarter ending January 31, 2023, there was 1 d ay of trading losses and trading net revenue was positive for 98% of the trading days, reflecting normal trading activity. Los ses in the quarter did not exceed aR on any trading day.

The Bank continuously improves its VaR methodologies and incorporates new risk measures in line with market conventions, industry best practices, and regulatory requirements. To mitigate some of the shortcomings of VaR, the Bank uses additional metrics designed for risk management and capital purposes. T hese include Stressed VaR, IRC, Stress Testing, as well as limits based on the sensitivity to various market risk factors. Calculating Stressed VaR In addition to VaR, the Bank also calculates Stressed VaR, which includes Stressed GMR and Stressed IDSR. Stressed VaR is designe d to measure the adverse i mpact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of stressed market conditions. Stressed VaR is d etermined using similar techniques and assumptions in GMR and IDSR VaR. However, instead of using the most recent 259 trading days (one year), the Bank uses a periodically reviewed and selected year of stressed market conditions. In the first quarter of 2023, Stressed VaR was calculated using the one-year period that includes the 2008 financial crisis. Stressed VaR is a part of regulatory capital requirements. Calculating the Incremental Risk Charge he IRC is applied to all instruments in the trading book subject to migration and default risk. Migration risk represents the r isk of changes in the credit ratings of the Bank’s exposures. TD applies a Monte Carlo simulation with a one-year horizon and a 99.9% confidence level to determine IRC, which is consistent with regulatory requirements. IRC is based on a “constant level of risk” assumption, which requires banks to assign a liquidity horizon to positions that are subject to C. IRC is a part of regulatory capital requirements.

It is not meaningful to compute a diversification effect because the high and low may occur on different days for different ris k types. Av erage VaR decreased quarter-over-quarter due to changes in interest rate risk positions and credit spread tightening. Average VaR increased year-over-year due to interest rate increases and credit spread widening in 2022, reflected in the historical VaR window. Average Stressed VaR decreased compared to both last quarter and same quarter last year due to changes in interest rate risk positions. verage IRC decreased compared to both last quarter and same quarter last year due to changes in bond positions. Validation of VaR Model he Bank uses a back-testing process to compare the actual and theoretical profit and losses to VaR to ensure that they are consistent with the statistical results of t he VaR model. The theoretical profit or loss is generated using the daily price movements on the assumption that there is no change in the composition of the portfolio. Validation of the IRC model must follow a different approach since the one-year horizon and 99.9% confidence level prec lude standard back-testing techniques. Instead, key parameters of the IRC model such as transition and correlation matrices are subject to independent valida tion by benchmarking against external study results or through analysis using internal or external data. Str uctural (Non-Trading) Interest Rate Risk The Bank’s structural interest rate risk arises from traditional personal and commercial banking activity and is generally the result of mismatches between the matur ities and repricing dates of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. The measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book does not include exposures from TD’s Whol esale Banking or Insurance businesses. The primary measures for this risk are Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivi ty (NIIS). Th e EVE Sensitivity measures the impact of a specified interest rate shock to the change in the net present value of the Bank’s banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items. It reflects a measurement of the potential present value impact on shareholders’ equity with out an assumed term profile for the managem ent of the Bank’s own equity and excludes product margins. The N IIS measures the NII change over a twelve-month horizon for a specified change in interest rates for banking book assets, li abilities, and certain off balance sheet items assuming a constant balance sheet over the period. The B ank’s Market Risk policy sets overall limits on the structural interest rate risk measures. These limits are periodically rev iewed and approved by the Risk Committee. In addition to the Board policy limits, book-level risk limits are set for the Bank’s management of non-trading interest rate risk by Risk Management. Ex posures against these limits are routinely monitored and reported, and breaches of the Board limits, if any, are escalated to both the Asset/Liability and Capital Committe e (ALCO) and the Risk Committee. The f ollowing table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rat es on the EVE and NIIS measures. Interest rate floors are applied by currency to the decrease in rates such that they do not exceed expected lower bounds, with the most material cur rencies set to a floor of -25 bps.

Since these swaps were pre-existing hedges which economically hedge the Bank’s non-trading market risk, their contin ued inclusion has no impact on the quarter over-quarter re sults. As at January 31, 2023, an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase in interest rates would have had a negative impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,610 million, an incre ase of $114 million from last quarter, and a positive impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,135 million, a decrease of $78 million from last quarter. An immediate and sustai ned 100 bps decrease in interest rates would have had a positive impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,056 million, a decrease of $46 million from last quarter, and a n egative impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,216 million, a decrease of $165 million from last quarter. The quarter-over-quarter inc rease in up shock EVE is primarily due to a small increase in rate sensitivity in the U.S. region. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in NII Sensitivity is primarily due to rising deposit betas and c hanges in deposit composition. TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

Financial obligations can arise from deposit withdrawals, debt maturities, commitments to provide credit or liquidity support, or the need to pledge additional collateral. TD’S he Bank maintains a prudent and disciplined approach to managing its potential exposure to liquidity risk. The Bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under a combined bank-specific and market-wide stress scenario, and a minimum buffer over regulatory requirements prescribed by OSFI’s Li quidity Adequacy equirements (LAR) guidelines. Under the LAR guidelines, Canadian banks are required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR ) at the minimum of 100% other than during periods of financial stress and to maintain a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at the minimum of 100%. The Bank’s funding program emphasizes maximizing deposits as a core source of funding, and having ready access to wholesale funding markets across diversified terms, fu nding types, and currencies that is designed to ensure low exposure to a sudden contraction of wholesale funding capacity and to minimize structural liquidity gaps. The Bank also maintains a contingency funding plan to enhance preparedness for recovery from potential liquidity stress events. The Bank’s strategies and actions comprise an integrated liqu idity risk management program that is designed to ensure low exposure to liquidity risk and compliance with regulatory requir ements. The Bank’s ALCO oversees the Bank’s liquidity risk management program. It ensures there are effective management structures and p ractices in place to properly measure and manage liquidity risk. The Global Liquidity & Funding Committee, a subcommittee of the ALCO comprised of senior mana gement from Treasury, isk Management and Wholesale Banking, identifies and monitors the Bank’s liquidity risks. The management of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the SET member responsible for Treasury, while oversight and challenge is provided by the ALCO and independently by Risk Management. The Risk Committee regularly reviews the Bank’s liquidity position and approves the Bank’s Liquidity Risk Management Framework bi-annually and the related poli cies annually. he Bank has established TDGUS as TD’s U.S. IHC, as well as a Combined U.S. Operations (CUSO) reporting unit that consists of the IHC and TD’s U.S. branch and agency network. Both TDGUS and CUSO are managed to the U.S. Enhanced Prudential Standards liquidity requirements in addition to the Bank’s liquidity management framework. he Bank’s liquidity risk appetite and liquidity risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in t he Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. or a complete discussion of liquidity risk, refer to the “Liquidity Risk” section in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. iquid assets The unencumbered liquid assets the Bank holds to meet its liquidity requirements must be high-quality securities that the Bank b elieves can be monetized quickly in stress conditions with minimum loss in market value. The liquidity value of unencumbered liquid assets considers estimated market or trading depths, settlement timing, and/or other identified impediments to potential sale or pledging. Overall, the Bank expects any reduction in market val ue of its liquid asset portfolio to be modest given its underlying high credit quality and demonstrated liquidity. ssets held by the Bank to meet liquidity requirements are summarized in the following tables. The tables do not include assets hel d within the Bank’s ins urance businesses as these are used to support insurance-specific liabilities and capital requirements.

Where a particular asset has been encumbered and TD has holdings of the asset both on-balance sheet and off balance sheet, for the purpose of this disclosure, the on- and off-balance sheet holdings are encumbered in alignment with the business practice. 2 Assets r eceived as collateral through off-balance sheet transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, margin loans, and other client activity. 3 Represents assets that have been posted externally to support the Bank’s day-to-day operations, including securities financing transactions, clearing and payments, and derivative transactions. Also includes assets that have been pledged supporting Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) activity. 4 Assets suppor ting TD’s long-term funding activities, assets pledged against securitization liabilities, and assets held by consolidated securitization vehicles or in pools for covered bond issuance. 5 Assets t hat are considered readily available in their current legal form to generate funding or support collateral needs. This category includes reported FHLB assets that remain unutilized and DSAC th at are available for collateral purposes however not regularly utilized in practice. 6 Assets that ca nnot be used to support funding or collateral requirements in their current form. This category includes those a ssets that are potentially eligible as funding program collateral or for pledging to central banks (for example, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation insured mortgages that can be se curitized into NHA MBS). 7 Includes trading loans, securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL and other financial assets designated at FVTPL, fina ncial assets at FVOCI, and DSAC. 8 Assets reporte d in the “Bank-owned assets” column represent the value of the loans extended and not the value of the collateral received. The loan value from the reverse repurchase transactions is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double-counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 9 The loan valu e from the margin loans/client activity is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities fina ncing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 10 Other assets include investment in Schwab, goodwill, other intangibles, land, buildings, equipment, and other depreciable asse ts, deferred tax assets, amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and c lients, and other assets on the balance sheet not reported in the above categories. In addition to the Severe Combined Stress Scenario, the Bank performs liquidity stress testing on multiple alternate scenarios. These scenarios are a mix of TD spec ific events and market-wide stress events designed to test the impact from risk factors material to the Bank’s risk profile. Liquidity assessments are also part of the Bank’s Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing program. he Bank has liquidity contingency funding plans (CFP) in place at the overall Bank level and for certain subsidiaries operating in fo reign jurisdictions (Regional CFPs). The Bank’s CFP provides a documented framework for managing unexpected liquidity situations and thus is an integral component of the Bank’s overall liqu idity risk management program. It outlines different contingency levels based on the severity and duration of the liquidity si tuation, and identifies recovery action s appropriate for each level. For each recovery action, it provides key operational steps required to execute the action. Regional CFPs identify recovery action s to address region-specific stress events. The actions and governance structure outlined in the Bank’s CFP are aligned with the Bank’s Crisis Management Reco very Plan. Credit ratings impact the Bank’s borrowing costs and ability to raise funds. Rating downgrades could potentially result in higher financing costs, increased requirements to pledge collateral, reduced access to capital markets, and could also affect the Bank’s ability to enter into deriva tive transactions. Credit ratings and outlooks provided by rating agencies reflect their views and are subject to change from time to time, based on a number of factors including the Bank’s financial strength, competitive position, and liquidity, as well as factors not entirely within the Bank’s control, in cluding the methodologies used by rating ag encies and conditions affecting the overall financial services industry."

The B ank regularly reviews the level of increased collateral its trading counterparties would require in the event of a downgrade of T D’s credit rating. The Bank holds liquid assets to ensure it is able to provide additional collateral required by trading counterparties in the event of a thr ee-notch downgrade in the Bank’s senior debt ratings. The following table presents the additional collateral that could have been contractually required to be posted to OTC derivative counterparties as of the reporting date in the event of one, two, and three-notch downgrades of the Bank’s credit ratings. TABLE 38: ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR RATING DOWNGRADES1 1 The above collateral requirements are based on each OTC trading counterparty’s Credit Support Annex and the Bank’s credit rating across applicable rating agencies.

These activities include clearing, custody, or cash management services. 7 Includes uncommitted credit and liquidity facilities, stable value money market mutual funds, outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, and other contractual cash outflows. With respect to outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, TD has no contractual obligation to buy back these outstanding TD debt se curities, and as a result, a 0% outflow rate is applied under the OSFI LAR guideline. 8 Total HQLA includes both asset haircuts and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (HQLA assets after haircuts are capped at 40% for Level 2 and 15% for Level 2B). 9 Total Net Cash Outflows include both inflow and outflow rates and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (in flows are capped at 75% of outflows). he Bank’s average LCR of 141% for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 continues to meet the regulatory requirements. he Bank holds a variety of liquid assets commensurate with the liquidity needs of the organization. Many of these assets qualify as HQLA under the OSFI LAR gui deline. The average HQLA of the Bank for the quarter ended Jan uary 31, 2023 was $355 billion (October 31, 2022 – $366 billion) , with Level 1 assets representing 84% (October 31, 2022 – 84%). The Bank’s reported HQLA excludes excess HQLA from the U.S. Retail operations, as req uired by the OSFI LAR guideline, to reflect liquidity transfer considerations between U.S. Retail and its affiliates as a result of the U.S. Federal R eserve Board’s regulations. By excluding excess HQLA, the U.S. Retail LCR is effectively capped at 100% prior to total Bank consolidation. s described in the “How TD Manages Liquidity Risk” section of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report, the Bank manages its HQLA and other liquidity buffers to the hig her of TD’s 90-day surplus requirement and the target buffers over regulatory requirements from the LCR, NSFR, and the Net Cu mulative Cash Flow (NCCF) metrics. As a result, the total stock of HQLA is subject to ongoing rebalancing against the projected liquidity requirements. The NSFR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of total available stable funding (ASF) over total required stable funding (RSF) in accordance with OSFI’s R guideline. The Bank must maintain an NSFR ratio equal to or above 100% in accordance with the LAR guideline. The Bank’s ASF com prises the Bank’s liability and capital instruments (including deposits and wholesale funding). The assets that require stable funding (RSF) are b ased on the Bank’s on and off bal ance sheet activities and a function of their liquidity characteristics and the requirements of OSFI’s LAR guideline.

These activities inclu de clearing, custody, or cash management services. 5 Interdependent asset and liability items are deemed by OSFI to be interdependent and have RSF and ASF risk factors adjusted to zero. Int erdependent liabilities cannot fall due while the asset is still on balance sheet, cannot be used to fund any other assets and principal payments from the asset cannot be used for anything other than repaying the liability. As such, the only inte rdependent assets and liabilities that qualify for this treatment at the Bank are the liabilities arising from the Can ada Mortgage Bonds Program and their corresponding encumbered assets. 6 Includes Residential Mortgages and HELOCs. The B ank’s NSFR for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 is at 125% (October 31, 2022 – 122%) and has met the regulatory requiremen ts. The NSFR changes quarter-to-quarter are based on a number of factors including deposit and loan growth, changes in capital levels, wholesale fundi ng issuance and maturities, and changes in the maturity profile of wholesale funding."

The Bank’s funding activities are conducted in accordance with liquidity risk management policies that require assets be funded to the appropriate term and to a prudent diversification profile. The Bank’s primary approach to managing funding activities is to maximize the use of deposits raised through personal and commerci al banking channels. The foll owing table illustrates the Bank’s large base of personal and commercial, wealth, and Schwab sweep deposits (collectively, “P&C deposits”) that make up over 70% of the Bank’s total funding.

The Bank maintains various registered external wholesale term (greater than 1 year) funding programs to provide access to diversified funding sources, including asset securitization, covered bonds, and unsecured wholesale debt. The Bank raises term funding through Senior Notes, NHA MBS, and notes backed by credit card receivables (Evergreen Credit Card Trust) and home equity lines of credit (Genesis Trust II). The Bank’s wholesale funding is diversified by geography, by currency, and by funding types. The Bank raises short-term (1 year or less) funding using certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and bankers’ acceptances. The f ollowing table summarizes the registered term funding and capital programs by geography, with the related program size as at January 31, 2023.

Exclu ding the Wholesale Banking residential mortgage trading business, the Bank’s total MBS issued to external investors for the three months ended Janu ary 31, 2023 was $0.4 billion (three months ended January 31, 2022 – $0.4 billion) and other asset-backed securities issued for the three months ended January 31, 2023 was $0.3 billion (three months ended January 31, 2022 – nil). The Bank also issued $12.9 billion of unsecured medium-term notes for the three mont hs ended January 31, 2023 (three months ended January 31, 2022 – $7.8 billion), in various currencies and markets. The total covered bonds issuance for the three months ended January 31, 2023, was nil (three months ended January 31, 2022 – nil). In January 2022, OSFI published finalized updates to its LAR guideline, following a public consultation period that began in March 2021. The primary changes to the L AR involve enhancements to the NCCF supervisory tool to impr ove the risk sensitivity of the metric. Other significant change s include the addition of contingencies for undrawn loan commitments, changes to certain loan cash inflows, and the adjustment of deposit runoff factors. The effective date of the changes will be April 2023. In January 2022, OSFI published an updated Pillar 3 Disclosure Guideline, which covers liquidity disclosures among other topics. The guideline provides OSFI’s updated expectations for the domestic implementation of Basel’s Pillar 3 Framework. The guideline will not materially impact the Bank’s existing liquidity dis closures, but will contribute to improved consistency and comparability of disclosures across jurisdictions. The effective date of the changes will be in the secon d fiscal quarter of 2023. Y ANALYSIS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS he following table summarizes on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet categories by remaining contractual maturity. Off-balance s heet commitments include contractual obligations to make future payments on certain lease-related commitments, certain purchase obligations, and other liabilities. The values of credit instrum ents reported in the following table represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the Bank could be obligated to extend should such instruments be fully dr awn or utilized. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon , the total of the contractual amounts is not representative of expected future liquidity requirements. These contractual obligations have an impact on the Bank’s short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The ma turity analysis presented does not depict the degree of the Bank’s maturity transformation or the Bank’s exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk. The Bank ensures that assets are appropriately funded to protect against borrowing cost volatility and potential reductions to funding market availability. The Bank utilizes stable non-maturity deposits (chequing and savings accounts) and term deposits as the primary source of long-term fundin g for the Bank’s non-trading assets including personal and business term loans and the stable balance of revolving lines of credit. Additionally, the Bank iss ues long-term funding in respect of such non-trading assets and raises short term funding primarily to finance trading assets. The liquidity of trading assets under s tressed market conditions is considered when determining the appropriate term of the funding.

        "page_content": "- TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 44 ITIZATION AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Bank enters into securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations. The Bank is involved with s tructured entities (SEs) that it sponsors, as well as entities sponsored by third parties. Refer to “Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section , Note 9: Transfers of Financial Asset s and Note 10: Structured Entities of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report for further details. There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended January 31, 2023. Secu ritization of Third Party-Originated Assets Si gnificant Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities The Bank securitizes third party-originated assets through Bank-sponsored SEs, including its Canadian multi-seller conduits which ar e not consolidated. These Cana dian multi-seller conduits securitize Canadian originated third-party assets. The Bank administers these multi-seller conduits an d provides liquidity facilities as well as securities distribution services; it may also provide credit enhancements. TD’s maximum potential exposure to loss due to its ownership interest in commerci al paper and through the provision of liquidity facilities for multi-seller conduits was $12.1 billion as at January 31, 20 23 (October 31, 2022 – $10.8 bil lion). In addition, as at January 31, 2023, the Bank had committed to provide $2.1 billion in liquidity facilities that can be used to support future asset backed commercial paper in the purchase of deal-specific assets (October 31, 2022 – $2.1 billion). Off-Balance Sheet Exposure to Third Party-Sponsored Conduits The B ank has off-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits arising from providing liquidity facilities and funding commitmen ts of $3.5 billion as at January 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $3.1 billion). The assets within these conduits are comprised of individual notes backed by automotive loan receivables, cre dit card receivables, equipment receivables and trade receivables. On-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits have been included in the fina ncial statements. The B ank’s unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. For details of the Ba nk’s accounting policies under IFRS, refer to Note 2 of the Bank’s first quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. For details of t he Bank’s significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions under IFRS, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s first quarter 20 23 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no new accounting policies that have been adopted by the Bank for the three months ended January 31, 2023. ING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The e stimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condit ion. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and ch anges to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologi es, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model he expected credit loss (ECL) model requires the application of estimates and judgment in the assessment of the current and forw ard-looking economic environment. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. o the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. In terest Rate Benchmark Reform Var ious interest rates and other indices that are deemed to be “benchmarks” (including Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) benchmarks s uch as the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR)) have been, and continue to be, the subject of international reg ulatory guidance and prop osals for reform. As a result of the global benchmark reform initiative, efforts to transition away from IBORs to alternative re ference rates (ARR) have been continuing in various jurisdictions. Fo llowing previous announcements by various regulators, the publication of LIBOR settings has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and euro, as w ell as the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings effective December 31, 2021. Six-month and twelve-month CDOR tenors ceased to be publi shed after May 17, 2021. The remaining USD LIBOR settings (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and twelve-month) will cease to be pu blished immediately after Jun e 30, 2023, while the remaining tenors of CDOR (one-month, two-month, and three-month) will cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. The Bank has incorporated these developments into its benchmark rate reform plan. To ensure an orderly transition, the Bank continu es to monitor developments and incorporate global working groups’ and regulators’ best practice guidance on transition activities. These activities include making available new products referencing ARRs, preparing to cease the issuance of the residual IBOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy contracts by in corporating appropriate fallback language, and preparing for overall operational readiness. The Bank is progressing on its transition plan and there were no significant changes to the Bank’ s transition risk with respect to the remaining USD LIBOR and CDOR exposures since October 31, 2022. For further details regarding interest rate benchmark reform, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2022."

Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups w hich are measured at the risk adj usted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provi ded over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the Bank. OSFI’s related Advis ory precludes early adoption. The standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The adoption of IFRS 17 is a significant initiative for the Bank and is supported by a robust governance structure. The Executive Steering Committee includes representation from the Insurance business, Finance, Actuaries, Risk, Technology, and project management teams. Updates are also provided to the TD insurance subsidiary boards, Risk Committee, and Audit Committee of the Bank. he Bank is proceeding with implementation of a software solution, including data preparation, system testing and configuration, and other implementation efforts accordingly. During the most recent interim period, there have been no changes in the Bank’s policies and procedures and other processes that comprise its internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting."

To arrive at adj usted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note”, from reported results. The items of note relate to items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance. Allowance for Credit Losses: Represent expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. Allowance for credit losses consists of Stage 3 allowance for impai red financial assets and Stage 2 and Stage 1 allowance for performing financial assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and dispo sals, and impacted by foreign exchange. Amortized Cost: The amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulat ive amortization, using EIRM, of any differences between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. Assets under Administration (AUA): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers where the Bank provides services of an administrative nature, such as the collection of investment income and the placing of trades on behalf of the clients (where the client has made his or her own investment selection). The majority of these assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet . Assets under Management (AUM): As sets that are beneficially owned by customers, managed by the Bank, where the Bank has discretion to make investment selections on behalf of the client (in accordance with an investment policy). In addition to the TD family of mutual funds, the Bank manages assets on be half of individuals, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments and foundations.

The shareholders of a bank are not, as shareholders, liable for any liability, act, or defa ult of the bank except as otherwise provided under the Ban k Act (Canada). The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Ban k Group (“TD” or the “Bank”). The Bank was formed through the amalgamation on February 1, 1955, of The Bank of Toronto (chartered in 1855) and T he Do minion Bank (chartered in 1869). The Bank is incorporated and domiciled in Canada with its registered and principal business offices located at 66 Wellington St reet West, Toronto, Ontario. TD serves customers in four business segments operating in a number of locations in key financial centres around the globe: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The accompanying Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting principles followed by t he Bank have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including the accounting requirements of the O ffice of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars, unless othe rwise indicated. The se Interim Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on a condensed basis in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, I nterim Financial Reporting using t he accounting policies as described in Note 2 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain comparative amo unts have been revised to conform with the presentation adopt ed in the current period. The preparation of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements requires that management make judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding the reported amount of as sets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as further described in Note 3 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in N ote 3 of this report. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future confirming events occur. The Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements ha ve been prepared using uniform accounting policies f or like transactions and events in similar circumstances. All intercompany transactions , balances, and un realized gains and losses on transactions are eliminated on consolidation. he Interim Consolidated Financial Statements f or the three months ended January 31, 2023, were approved and authorized for issue by the Bank’s Board of Directors, in accordance with a recommendation of the Audit Committee, on March 1, 2023. As the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of t he disclosures normally provided in the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, they shou ld be read in conjunction with the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the a ccompanying Notes, and the shaded sections of the 2022 anagement’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The risk management policies and procedures of t he Bank are provided in the MD&A. The shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the MD&A in this report, relating to market, liquidity, and insurance risks, are an integral part of these Interim Consolidated Financial Sta tements, as permitted by IFRS. NOTE 2: CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES There were no new accounting policies that have b een adopted by the Bank for the three months ended January 31, 2023. The following standard has been issued, but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. nsurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, In surance Contracts (I FRS 17) which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and establishes principles for recognition, mea surement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are a ggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are pro vided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective f or annual reporting periods beginning on or after J anuary 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the Bank. OSFI’s related Advi sory precludes early adoption. T he standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The adoption of IFRS 17 is a significant initiative for the Bank and is supported by a robust governance structure. The Executive Steering Committee includes representation from t he Insurance business, Fi nance, Actuaries, R isk, Technology, and project management teams. Updates are also provided to the TD insurance subsidiary boards, Risk Committee, and Audit Committee of the Bank. The Bank is proceeding with implementation of a software solution, including data preparation, system testing and configuration, and o ther implementation efforts accordingly.

Some of t he Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as t hey relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and c hanges to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has es tablished procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopt ing new accounting standards are we ll-controlled and oc cur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Con solidated Financial Statements f or a description of significant accounting judgments, e stimates, and assumptions. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The expected credit loss (ECL) model requires the application of e stimates and judgment in t he assessment of the current and forward-looking economic envi ronment. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and management continues to e xercise expert credit judgment in ass essing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in c redit risk since initial recognition and in d etermining the amount of E CLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not f ully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Various interest rates and other indices that are deemed to be “benchmarks” (including Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) benchmarks such as the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR)) have been, and continue to b e, the subject of international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. As a re sult of the global benchmark reform initiative, efforts to t ransition away from IBORs to al ternative reference rates (ARR) have been con tinuing in various jurisdictions. Fol lowing previous announcements by various regulators, the publication of L IBOR settings has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and euro, as well as the one -week and two-month USD LIBOR settings effective December 31, 2021. Six-month and twelve-month CDOR tenors ceased to be publi shed after Ma y 17, 2021. The remaining USD LIBOR settings (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and twelve-month) will cease to be published immediately after June 30, 2023, while the re maining tenors of CDOR (one-month, t wo-month, and three-month) will cease following a final publication on June 28 , 2024. The Bank has incorporated these developments into its benchmark rate reform plan. To en sure an orderly transition, the Bank continues to monitor developments and incorporate global working groups’ and regulators’ best practice guidance on transition activities. These activities include making available new products refer encing ARRs, preparing to cease the issuance of the residual IBOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy contracts by incorporating appropriate fallb ack language, and preparing for ov erall operational readiness. The B ank is progressing on its transition plan and there were no significant changes to the Bank’s transition risk with respect to the remaining USD LIBOR and CDOR exposures since October 31, 2022. For further details regarding interest rate benchmark reform, refer to N ote 3 of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2022.

Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also inco rporated, where relevant. The key macroeconomic variables used in dete rmining ECLs include regional unemployment rates for all ret ail exposures and regional housing price indices for residential mortgages and home equity lines of cr edit. For business and government loans, the key macroeconomic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, and credit spreads. Refer to Note 3 of t he Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of how forward-looking information is generated and considered in determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and in measuring ECLs. Mac roeconomic Variables Select macroeconomic variables are projected over the forecast period. The following table represents the average values of t he macroeconomic variables over the four calendar quarters starting with the current quarter, and the remaining 4-year forecast period for the base forecast and upside and downside scenarios used in determining the Bank’s ECLs as at January 31, 2023. As the forecast period increases, information about the future becomes less readily available and projections are anc hored on assumptions around structural relationships between economic parameters that are inherently much less certain. Ongoing geopolitical ten sions, and heightened inflationary pressures, whic h have led to a rapid tightening in mo netary policy continue to contribute to elevated economic uncertainty, leading to deterioration in our economic forecasts.

(f) SENSITIVITY OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ECLs are sensitive to the inputs used in internally developed models, the macroeconomic variables in the forward-looking forecasts and re spective probability weight ings in determining the pr obability-weighted ECLs, and othe r factors considered when applying expert credit judgment. Ch anges in these inputs, assumptions, models, and judgments would affect the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the m easurement of ECLs. The following table presents the base ECL scenario compared to the probability-weighted ECLs, with the latter derived from three ECL scenarios for performing loans and of f-balance sheet instruments. The difference reflects the impact of deriving multiple scenarios around the base ECLs and resultant change in EC Ls due to non-linearity and sensitivity to us ing macroeconomic forecasts. Change from Base to Probability-Weighted ECLs (million s of Canadian dollars, except as noted) As a t January 31, 2023 Octobe r 31, 2022 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 6,645 $ 6, 599 Base E CLs 6,192 6,095 Dif ference – in amount $ 453 $ 504 Dif ference – in percentage 7.3 % 8.3 % Ls for performing loans and of f-balance sheet instruments consist of an aggregate amount of S tage 1 and Stage 2 probability-weighted ECLs which are twelve month ECLs and lifetime ECLs, respectively. Transfers from Stage 1 to St age 2 ECLs result from a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the loan. T he following table s hows the estimated impact of staging on ECLs by p resenting all performing loans and o ff-balance sheet instruments calculated using tw elve-month ECLs compared to the current aggregate probability-weighted ECLs, holding all ris k profiles constant.

The Bank does not generally occupy foreclosed properties for its business use. The Bank predominantly relies on third-party appraisals to determine the carrying value of foreclosed assets. Foreclosed as sets held for sale were $54 million as at January 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $51 million), and were recorded in Other assets on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet.

As such, the Bank accounts for its investment in Sc hwab using the equity method. The Bank ’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to c ommon shareholders is reported with a one -month lag. The Bank takes into account changes in the one-month lag period that would signi ficantly affect the results. As at January 31, 2023, the Bank’s reported investment in Schwab was appro ximately 12.2% (October 31, 2022 – 12.1%), consisting of 9.7% of the outstanding voting common shares and the remainder in non-v oting common shares of Schwab with a fair value of $23 billion (US$17 billion) (October 31, 2022 – $24 bi llion (US$18 billion)) based on the closing price of US$77.42 (October 31, 2022 – US$79.67) on the New York Stock Exchange. The Bank and Schwab are party to a stockholder agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”) under which the Bank has the right to designate two members of Sc hwab’s Board of Directors and has representation on t wo Board Committees, subject to the Bank meeting certain conditions. The Bank’s designated directors currently are the Bank’s Group President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank’s Chair of the Board. Under the Stockholder Agreement, the Bank is not perm itted to own more than 9.9% voting common shares of Schwab, and the Bank is subject to customary standstill restrictions and, subject to c ertain exceptions, transfer restrictions. In addition, the Schwab IDA Agreement has an initial expiration date of J uly 1, 2031. Pursuant to the Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank ma kes sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Starting July 1, 2021, deposits can be reduced at Schwab’s option by up to US$10 billion in a year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floorof US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab has requested some operational flexibility such that the sweep depos it balances may fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to cer tain limitations. The carrying value of the Bank’s investment in Sc hwab of $8.4 billion as at January 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $8.1 billion) represents the Ban k’s share of Schwab’s stockholders’ equity, adjusted for goodwill, other intangibles, and cumulative translation adjustment. The Bank’s share of net income from its investment in Schwab of $285 million during the three months ended January 31, 2023 ( three months ended January 31, 2022 – $231 million), reflects net income after adjus tments for amortization of cer tain intangibles net of tax. The following tables represent t he gross amount of Schwab’s total assets, liabilities, net revenues, net income available to common stockholders, other comprehensive in come (loss), and c omprehensive income (loss).

On March 1, 2023, the Bank completed the acquisition of Cowen Inc. (“ Cowen”). The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and primarily reported in t he Wholesale Banking segment. Due to the timing of the acquisition closing in relation to the release date of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, the Bank has not yet finalized the initial accounting for the acquisition as the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities ass umed has not been completed. Pending Acquisition of First Horizon Corporation On February 28, 2022, the Bank and F irst Horizon Corporation (“First Horizon”) announced a definitive agreement for the Bank to acquire First Horizon in an all cash transaction valued at US$13.4 billion, or US$25.00 for each common share of First Horizon. In connection with this transaction, the Bank has invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock (convertible in certain circumstances into up to 4.9% of First Horizon’s common stock). First Horizon shareholders will receive, at c losing, an additional US$0.65 per s hare on an annualized basis for the period from November 27, 2022 through the day immediately prior to the closing. On February 9, 2023, the parties announced they had mutually agreed to extend the outside date to May 27, 2023, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. The closing of t he transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities, which now are not expected to be obtained prior to May 27, 2023. Regulatory approvals are not within the Bank’s control. If the merger does not close by May 27, 2023, then an amendment to the merger agreement would be required to further extend the outside date. TD and First Horizon are discussing a potential further extension. The Bank has implemented a strategy to mitigate the impact of interest rate volatility to capital on closing of the acquisition. The fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets are sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net as sets will determine the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles will negatively impact capital ratio s because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships. Sinc e the de-des ignation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps are recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged in vestments. Such gains (losses) will mitigate the capital impact from changes in t he amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de des ignation also triggered the amortization of the in vestments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of t he investments. For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank reported ($998) million in non- interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $122 million in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank reported $251 million in non-int erest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps.

For LRCNs, the number of shares represents the number of notes issued. 2 When the Bank purchases its own equity instruments as part of its tradi ng business, they are classified as treasury instruments and the cost of these instruments is recorded as a reduction in equity. On March 1, 2023, the Board approved a dividend in an amount of ninety-six cents (96 cents) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the Bank for the quart er ending April 30, 2023, payable on and after April 30, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 6, 2023. The Bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan for its common shareholders. Participation in t he plan is optional and under t he terms of the plan, cash dividends on common shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average mar ket price based on the last five trading days before the date of t he dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion or purchased from the open market at m arket price. The Bank had determined that, beginning with the dividend approved on M ay 25, 2022 for the quarter ending Jul y 31, 2022, and until further announcement, the Bank will issue the common shares from treasury and will apply a 2% discount to the average market price on su ch common shares. Duri ng the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank issued 7.9 million common shares from t reasury with a 2% discount. During the three months ended January 31, 2022, under the dividend reinvestment plan , the Bank issued 1.2 million common s hares from t reasury with no discount. NOTE 14: SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank recognized compensation expense for stock option awards of $11.1 million (three months ended anuary 31, 2022 – $10.1 million).

This bill e nacted the Canada Recovery Dividend (C RD) and increased the Canadian federal tax rate for bank and life insurer groups by 1 .5%. The implementation of the CRD resulted in a provision for income taxes of $553 million and a charge to other comprehensive income of $239 million, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the Canadian federal tax rate of 1.5%, prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, resulted in a provision for income taxes of $82 million and a tax benefit of $7 5 million in other comprehensive income related to fiscal 2022, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank also remeasured cer tain Canadian deferred tax assets and lia bilities for the increase in t ax rate, which resulted in an increase in net deferred tax assets of $50 million, which is recorded in provision for income taxes.

During the quarter, the RQA reassessed the Bank for $5 million of additional income tax and interest in respect of its 2016 t axation year. As at January 31, 2023, the CRA has reassessed the Bank for $1,646 million of income tax and interest for the years 2011 to 2017, the RQA has re assessed the Bank for $39 million for the years 2011 to 2016, and the ATRA has reassessed the Bank for $54 million for the years 2011 to 2016. In total, the Ban k has been reassessed for $1,739 million of in come tax and in terest. The Bank expects to c ontinue to be reassessed for open years. The Bank is of the view that its tax filing positions were appropriate and intends to challenge all reassessments. NOTE 17: EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the same method as basic earnings per share except that certain adjustments are made to net income attributable to co mmon shareholders and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares that are ass umed to be issued by the Bank. The following table presents the Bank’s basic and diluted earnings per s hare for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022. Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share (mill ions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) For the three months ended January 31 2023 January 31 2022 Basic earnings per share Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,49 9 $ 3,69 0 Wei ghted-average number of common shares outstanding (millions) 1,82 0.7 1,820.5 Basic earnings per share (Canadian dollars) $ 0.82 $ 2.03 Diluted earnings per share Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,49 $ 3,69 0 Ne t income available to common shareholders including impact of dilutive securities 1,499 3,69 0 Wei ghted-average number of common shares outstanding (millions) 1,82 0.7 1,820.5 Effect of dilutive securities Stock options potentially exercisable (millions)1 2.4 3. 6 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding – diluted (millions) 1,82 3.1 1,824.1 Diluted earnings per share (Canadian dollars)1 $ 0.82 $ 2.02 1 For the three months ended January 31, 2023, the computation of diluted earnings per share excluded average options outstanding of 3.7 million, with a weighted-average exercise price of $93.69, as the option price was greater than the average market price of the Bank’s common shares.

In the ordinary course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are in volved in various legal and regulatory actions, including but not limited to c ivil claims and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits, and requests for information by governmental, regulatory and self-regulatory agencies and law enfo rcement authorities in various jurisdictions. The Bank establishes provisions when it becomes probable that the Bank will incur a loss and t he amount can be reliably estimated. The Bank also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) in i ts legal and regulatory actions (that is, those which are neith er probable nor remote), in excess of provisions. As at January 31, 2023, the Bank’s RPL is from zero to approximately $1.25 billion (October 31, 2022 – fro m zero to approximately $1.26 billion). The Bank’s provisions and RPL represent the Ban k’s best estimates based upon c urrently available information for actions for which estimates can be made, but there are a number of factors that could cause the Bank ’s provisions and/or RPL to be significantly different from its ac tual or RPL. For example, the Ban k’s estimates involve significant judgment due to the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants in many proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, some of which are beyond the Bank’s control and/or involve novel legal theories and interpretations, the attendant uncertainty of t he various potential outcomes of such proceedings, and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. In addition, some actions seek very large or indeterminate damages. In m anagement’s opinion, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the ultimate disposition of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on t he consolidated financial condition or the consolidated ca sh flows of the Bank. However, because of the factors listed above, as well as other uncertainties inherent in li tigation and regulatory matters, there is a possibility that the ultimate resolution of legal or regulatory actions may be material to the Bank’s consolidated results of operations for any particular reporting period. Sta nford Litigation – In the US Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al action, on February 24, 2023, the Bank reached a settlement in principle pursuant to w hich the Bank will pay US$1.205 billion to Ralph S. Janvey, solely in his capacity as the court-appointed receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate, the Official Stanford Investors Committee and each of the Rotstain et al v. Trustmark National Bank et al and Sm ith et al v. Independent Bank Actions. Under the terms of the agreement, all involved parties have agreed to a bar order dismissing and releasing all current or future claims arising from or related to Stanford. The settlement is subject to court approval. A case regarding the same facts was also brought in O ntario. On November 17, 2022, the Court of Appeal for Ontario issued a unanimous written decision w hich dismissed the appeal and affirmed the trial decision.On J anuary 16, 2023, the Joint Liquidators filed an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Bank filed a response to t he leave application on February 22, 2023.

The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in rel ation to credit, market, and operational risks. The Ba nk has various capital policies, procedures, and controls which it utilizes to achieve its goals and objectives. On November 22, 2019, the Bank was des ignated a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).

Eff ective January 1, 2016, OSFI’s target Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios for Canadian banks designated as do mestic systemically imp ortant banks (D-SIBs) includes a 1% common equity capital surcharge bringing the targets to 8 %, 9.5%, and 11.5%, respectively. On June 25, 2018, OSFI provided greater transparency related to pre viously undisclosed Pillar 2 CET1 capital buffers through the introduction of t he public Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) which is held by D-SIBs against Pillar 2 risks. The current published buffer is s et at 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets (RWA) and must be met with CET1 Capital, effectively raising OSFI’s pu blished CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital minimum target ratios to 10.5%, 12.0%, and 14.0%, respectively. The OSFI target includes the greater of the D-SIB or G- SIB surcharge, both of which are currently 1%. On September 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). Under this guideline, the Bank wa s required to meet a supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.0% of RWA, inclusive of the 2.50% DSB, and a TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75% by November 1, 2021. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio. On December 8, 2022, OSFI announced that the DSB level will be s et at 3% as of February 1, 2023. The following table summarizes the Bank’s regulatory capital positions as at January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022.
