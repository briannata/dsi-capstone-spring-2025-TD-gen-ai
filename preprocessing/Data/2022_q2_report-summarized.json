TORONTO, May 26, 2022 – TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended April 30, 2022. Reported earnings were $3.8 billion, up 3% compared with the second quarter last year, and adjusted earnings were $3.7 billion, down 2%. “TD’s second quarter performance reflects the strength of our diversified business model and customer-centric approach,” said Bharat Masrani, Group President and CEO, TD Bank Group. “We have delivered strong revenue growth across our businesses and we enter the second half of the year well-positioned to support households and businesses as they navigate an evolving economic environment. TD will continue to invest in our people, technology and innovation to exceed our customers’ rapidly changing expectations and help shape the future of banking.” Canadian Retail saw strong revenue growth supported by continued volume momentum Canadian Retail net income was $2,236 million, an increase of 2% compared with the second quarter last year. The increase in earnings reflects strong revenue, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses, insurance claims, and provisions for credit losses (PCL). Revenue increased 9%, reflecting continued growth in volume as well as strong other income. Expenses increased 9%, reflecting investments to support business growth, including technology enhancements, higher employee-related expenses, and variable compensation. PCL of $60 million reflects a lower recovery in performing PCL compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower impaired PCL. Momentum continued this quarter with Canadian Retail delivering record revenue in the Personal and Commercial Bank supported by increased customer activity and strong growth in commercial lending. TD Insurance achieved strong earnings this quarter and continued to grow market share in property and casualty insurance. In Wealth, net asset growth partially offset trading volume normalization to deliver solid revenue for the business. This quarter, TD enhanced its credit cards rewards offering, launching My TD Rewards, a loyalty and rewards hub available through EasyWeb and the TD Mobile App. My TD Rewards offers customers a convenient way to access and redeem rewards and loyalty benefits through collaborations with leading global brands such as Amazon, Expedia and recently announced Starbucks Canada. Strengthening its position in online and mobile platforms, TD received the Celent 2022 Model Bank Award for Customer Engagement and was also recognized by the Business Intelligence Group for innovation in artificial intelligence, both for the second consecutive year. The U.S. Retail Bank delivered solid loan and deposit volumes, driven by increased customer activity U.S. Retail net income for the quarter was $1,367 million (US$1,079 million), an increase of 4% (3% in U.S. dollars) compared with the second quarter last year. Reported net income included an insurance recovery related to litigation of $224 million (US$177 million) or $169 million (US$133 million) after-tax. On an adjusted basis, net income for the quarter was $1,198 million (US$946 million), a decrease of 9% (10% in U.S. dollars). The Bank’s investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation (Schwab) contributed $224 million (US$177 million) in earnings, a decrease of 9% (9% in U.S. dollars) compared with the second quarter last year. The U.S. Retail Bank, which excludes the Bank’s investment in Schwab, reported net income of $1,143 million (US$902 million), an increase of 7% (6% in U.S. dollars) from the second quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher revenue, including the insurance recovery related to litigation, partially offset by higher PCL, reflecting a lower recovery in performing PCL. On an adjusted basis, net income was $974 million (US$769 million), a decrease of 9% (10% in U.S. dollars), driven primarily by a lower recovery in performing PCL, lower income from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), higher employee-related expenses and business investments, partially offset by higher deposit volume and margin, and increased earnings on the investment portfolio and customer activity. U.S. Retail continued to sustain business momentum in the second quarter, with improved commercial loan originations in the middle market and specialty lending businesses that allowed the Bank to deliver 0.4% loan growth over the prior quarter despite the significant wind-down in PPP volumes, as compared to a 4.2% decrease in average loan volumes over the same quarter last year. In addition, the U.S. Retail Bank sustained consumer loan growth in mortgages, auto and credit Page 1",
        "summary": "TD Bank Group reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2022, showing a 3% increase in reported net income to $3.8 billion, while adjusted net income decreased by 2% to $3.7 billion compared to the same quarter last year. The reported diluted earnings per share rose to $2.07 from $1.99, whereas adjusted diluted earnings per share slightly decreased to $2.02 from $2.04. Canadian Retail experienced strong revenue growth, driven by increased customer activity and commercial lending, despite higher non-interest expenses and provisions for credit losses. The U.S. Retail Bank saw a 4% increase in net income, supported by higher revenue and insurance recovery related to litigation, although adjusted net income decreased by 9% due to lower recoveries in performing provisions for credit losses and reduced income from the Paycheck Protection Program. TD Bank continues to invest in technology and innovation, enhancing its credit card rewards program and receiving recognition for customer engagement and artificial intelligence innovation."

This MD&A is dated May 25, 2022. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars and have been primarily derived from the Bank’s 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes or Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes, prepared in accordance with I FRS as issued b y t he IASB. Note that certain c omparative a mounts have b een r evised to conform with the presentation adopted in the current period.

Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements From time to time, the Bank (as defined in this document) makes written and/or oral forward-looking statements, including in this document, in other filings with Canadian regulators or the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in other communications. In addition, representatives of the Bank may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. All such statements are made pursuant to the “safe harbour” provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“2021 MD&A”) in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report under the headings “Economic Summary and Outlook” and “The Bank’s Response to COVID-19”, under the headings “Key Priorities for 2022” and “Operating Environment and Outlook” for the Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading “Focus for 2022” for the Corporate segment, and in other statements regarding the Bank’s objectives and priorities for 2022 and beyond and strategies to achieve them, the regulatory environment in which the Bank operates, the Bank’s anticipated financial performance, and the potential economic, financial and other impacts of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “will”, “would”, “should”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”, “plan”, “goal”, “target”, “may”, and “could”. By their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond the Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, and infrastructure), model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors include the economic, financial, and other impacts of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates; geopolitical risk; the ability of the Bank to execute on long­ term strategies and shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions, business retention plans, and strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks or data security breaches) on the Bank’s information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; model risk; fraud activity; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the Bank’s use of third-party service providers; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations, including without limitation tax laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance and the bank recapitalization “bail-in” regime; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; exposure related to significant litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes to the Bank’s credit ratings; changes in currency and interest rates (including the possibility of negative interest rates); increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition risk; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Bank; existing and potential international debt crises; environmental and social risk (including climate change); and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events. The Bank cautions that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Bank’s results. For more detailed information, please refer to the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as applicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the heading “Pending Acquisition” or “Significant and Subsequent Events and Pending Acquisitions” in the relevant MD&A, which applicable releases may be found on www.td.com. All such factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, should be considered carefully when making decisions with respect to the Bank. The Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on the Bank’s forward-looking statements. Material economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this document are set out in the 2021 MD&A under the headings “Economic Summary and Outlook” and “The Bank’s Response to COVID-19”, under the headings “Key Priorities for 2022” and “Operating Environment and Outlook” for the Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading “Focus for 2022” for the Corporate segment, each as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders. Any forward-looking statements contained in this document represent the views of management only as of the date hereof and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank’s shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank’s financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, and may not be appropriate for other purposes.

To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts reported results for “items of note”. Refer to the “How We Performed” section of this document for further explanation, a list of the items of note, and a reconciliation of adjusted to reported results. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. 2 These measures have been included in this document in accordance with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institution s Canada’s (OSFI’s) Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR), Leverage Requirements, and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guidelines.

TD is the fifth largest bank in North America by assets a nd serves more than 26 million c ustomers in three key b usinesses operating in a number of locations in f inancial centres around the globe: Canadian Retail, including TD Canada Trust, TD Auto Finance Canada, TD Wealth (Canada), TD Direct Investing, and TD Insurance; U.S. Retail, including TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank®, TD Auto Finance U.S., TD Wealth (U.S.), and an investment in Schwab; and Wholesale Banking, including TD Securities. TD also ranks among the world’s leading online financial services firms, with more than 15 million active online and mobile customers. TD had $1.8 trillion in assets on April 30, 2022. The Toronto-Dominion Bank trades under the symbol “TD” on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges. The Bank prepares its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS and refers to results prepared in accordance with IFRS as “reported” results. Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures In addition to reported results, the Bank also presents certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures that are historical, non-GAAP ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures, to assess its results. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as “adjusted” results, are utilized to assess the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts reported results for “items of note”. Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP ratios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the Bank’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. Supplementary financial measures depict the Bank’s financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the Bank’s capital position, and both are explained in this document where they first appear. U.S. Strategic Cards The Bank’s U.S. strategic cards portfolio is comprised of agreements with certain U.S. retailers pursuant to which TD is the U.S. issuer of private label and co- branded consumer credit cards to their U.S. customers. Under the terms of the individual agreements, the Bank and the retailers share in the profits generated by the relevant portfolios after credit losses. Under IFRS, TD is required to present the gross amount of revenue and PCL related to these portfolios in the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Statement of Income. At the segment level, the retailer program partners’ share of revenues and credit losses is presented in the Corporate segment, with an offsetting amount (representing the partners’ net share) recorded in Non-interest expenses, resulting in no impact to Corporate’s reported Net income (loss). The Net income (loss) included in the U.S. Retail segment includes only the portion of revenue and credit losses attributable to TD under the agreements. Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation On October 6, 2020, the Bank acquired an approximately 13.5% stake in Schwab following the completion of Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade (“Schwab transaction”). For further details, refer to Note 7 of the second quarter of 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method and reports its after-tax share of Schwab’s earnings with a one-month lag. The U.S. Retail segment reflects the Bank’s share of net income from its investment in Schwab. The Corporate segment net income (loss) includes amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction.

By segment, the increase in reported non-interest income reflects an increase in Canadian Retail of $286 million, an increase in U.S. Retail of $201 million, and an increase in the Corporate segment of $24 million, partially offset by a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $18 million. Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q1 2022 Reported non-interest income for the quarter decreased $93 million, or 2%, compared with the prior quarter. The decrease primarily reflects lower fee and transaction-based revenue in the banking and wealth businesses, lower wholesale trading revenue, and a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in insurance claims, partially offset by an insurance recovery related to litigation. Adjusted non-interest income was $4,662 million, a decrease of $317 million, or 6%. By segment, the decrease in reported non-interest income reflects a decrease in Canadian Retail of $158 million, and a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $146 million, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Retail of $193 million and an increase in the Corporate segment of $18 million. Year-to-date comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q2 2021 Reported non-interest income was $9,865 million, an increase of $690 m illion, or 8%, compared with the same period last year. The increase reflects higher fee- based revenue in the banking and wealth businesses, an insurance recovery related to litigation, and prior year premium rebates for customers in the insurance business, partially offset by lower transaction revenue in the wealth business and a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in insurance claims. Adjusted non-interest income was $9,641 million, an increase of $466 million, or 5%. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest income reflects an increase in Canadian Retail of $552 million, and an increa se in U.S. Retail of $219 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Corporate segment of $51 million and a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $30 million. Provision for Credit Losses Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q2 2021 PCL for the quarter was $27 million, compared with a recovery of $377 million in the second quarter last year. PCL – impaired was $314 million, a decrease of $67 million, largely related to improved credit conditions. PCL – performing was a recovery of $287 million, compared with a recovery of $758 million in the prior year. The performing release this quarter reflects improved credit conditions, partially offset by elevated economic uncertainty. Total PCL for the quarter as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.01%. By segment, the increase in PCL reflects an increase in U.S. Retail of $195 million, an increase in Canadian Retail of $97 million, an increase in the Corporate segment of $58 million and an increase in Wholesale Banking of $54 million. Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q1 2022 PCL for the quarter decreased $45 million or 63% compared with the prior quarter. PCL – impaired decreased by $15 million. PCL – performing was a recovery of $287 million, compared with a recovery of $257 million in the prior quarter. The performing release this quarter reflects improved credit conditions, partially offset by elevated economic uncertainty. Total PCL for the quarter as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.01%. By segment, the decrease in PCL reflects a decrease in U.S. Retail of $39 million, a decrease in the Corporate segment of $29 million, and a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $4 million, partially offset by an increase in Canadian Retail of $27 million. Year-to-date comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q2 2021 PCL was $99 million, higher by $163 million, compared with the same period last year. PCL – impaired was $643 million, a decrease of $204 million, largely related to improved credit conditions. PCL – performing was a recovery of $544 million, compared with a recovery of $911 million in the same period last year. The current year performing release reflects improved credit conditions including a more favourable outlook, partially offset by elevated uncertainty. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.03%. By segment, the increase in PCL reflects an increase in U.S. Retail of $81 million, an increase in the Corporate segment of $65 million, and an increase in Wholesale Banking of $29 million, partially offset by a decrease in Canadian Retail of $12 million.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Foreign Exchange Impact**: The U.S. Retail segment's earnings were affected by foreign exchange rates, with a slight decrease in translated earnings compared to the previous year.\n\n2. **Earnings Performance**: Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 6% for the six months ending April 30, 2022. The reported net income for Q2 2022 was $3,811 million, a 3% increase from Q2 2021, driven by higher revenues but offset by increased provisions for credit losses (PCL), non-interest expenses, and insurance claims.\n\n3. **Segment Performance**: Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and the Corporate segment saw increases in reported net income, while Wholesale Banking experienced a decline.\n\n4. **Net Interest Income**: There was a 9% increase in reported net interest income for Q2 2022 compared to Q2 2021, attributed to growth in personal and commercial banking, higher trading net interest income, and foreign exchange translation.\n\n5. **Non-Interest Income**: Reported non-interest income rose by 11% in Q2 2022 compared to Q2 2021, due to higher fee-based revenue and an insurance recovery, despite lower transaction revenue in the wealth business.\n\n6. **Provision for Credit Losses (PCL)**: PCL increased compared to the previous year, reflecting improved credit conditions but also elevated economic uncertainty. The total PCL for Q2 2022 was $27 million, with a significant increase in U.S. Retail and Canadian Retail segments.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group showed growth in earnings and net interest income, with some challenges in non-interest income and credit loss provisions."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Income Taxes As discussed in “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in the “How We Performed” section of this document, the Bank adjusts its reported results to assess each of its businesses and to measure overall Bank performance. As such, the provision for income taxes is stated on a reported and an adjusted basis. The Bank’s effective income tax rate on a reported basis was 21.7% for the current quarter, compared with 21.7% in the second quarter last year and 21.9% in the prior quarter, with slight changes primarily due to business mix. To allow for an after-tax calculation of adjusted income, the adjusted provision for income taxes is calculated by adjusting the taxes for each item of note using the statutory income tax rate of the applicable legal entity. The adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes before other taxes as a percentage of adjusted net income before taxes. The Bank’s adjusted effective income tax rate was 21.6% for the current quarter, compared with 21.7% in the second quarter last year and 22.0% in the prior quarter, with slight changes primarily due to business mix. Adjusted results are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers.

Proposed Tax Measures in the Canadian Federal Budget The Canadian Federal budget presented on April 7, 2022 (“the Budget”) proposes to introduce a tax on bank and life insurer groups, referred to as the Canada Recovery Dividend. This is expected to be in the form of a 15% tax on the 2021 taxable income above $1 billion, paid in equal instalments over five years. The Budget also proposes to introduce an additional permanent tax on bank and life insurer groups of 1.5% of taxable income above $100 million. The additional tax would apply to taxation years that end after April 7, 2022 and will be prorated for the first year. These taxes, if enacted as proposed, will result in higher amounts of taxes payable in each of the impacted years, as well as revaluation adjustments to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Bank is monitoring the status of the Budget proposals and will determine the impact to the Bank’s results when the legislation is substantively enacted. After a rebound in calendar 2021, the outlook for the global economy in 2022 has been downgraded in large part because of Russia’s war in Ukraine. In addition to the direct impacts in the affected regions and related financial market volatility, the war has pushed prices higher for many commodities including oil, natural gas, and wheat. Inflation was already elevated prior to these impacts, and global central banks are expected to raise rates more aggressively to try to tamp down demand, and ease inflation pressures. It is highly uncertain whether monetary authorities will achieve this without triggering a more pronounced slowdown. COVID-19 also continues to affect the economic outlook. The removal of Omicron-related government restrictions on businesses and households within many advanced economies has permitted a rebound in economic activity in the first calendar quarter. However, it is also continuing to cause challenges for global supply chains. China’s “zero COVID” policy has led to restrictions within densely populated areas of the country, restraining economic activity and maintaining disruptions to downstream supply chains in many industries. The U.S. economy started 2022 on a weak note, contracting 1.4% annualized in the first calendar quarter. This marked a significant slowdown from 6.9% growth in the fourth calendar quarter of 2021. However, the contraction was entirely due to an unusually large drag from net exports and business inventories, without which gross domestic product (GDP) would have grown by 2.6%. In contrast, growth in consumer spending remained resilient at 2.7%, slightly better than the 2.5% outcome in the previous calendar quarter. Business investment was strong, advancing by 9.2%, a significant improvement from a 2.9% pace in the fourth calendar quarter. In addition, the U.S. labour market continued to make considerable strides, with an average of 562,000 new jobs added to employer payrolls per month in the first calendar quarter of 2022. The unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in April 2022, only 0.1 percentage point above its February 2020 pre-pandemic low. With historically high job openings, the mismatch between labour supply and demand has pushed up nominal wage growth to the highest rate in over 25 years. The Federal Reserve responded to high inflation by raising the Federal Funds rate 25 basis points (bps) in March and 50 bps in early May, in addition to announcing that it will begin tapering the size of its balance sheet in the coming months. TD Economics expects two more 50 basis point hikes at each of its next two meetings, and a return of the Federal Funds rate to 2.50% before the end of the calendar year. The risks to this outlook are two-sided. While these policy actions are expected to lead to a moderation in economic growth and inflationary pressures, the risk is that economic growth could slow more than desired. The Canadian economy accelerated in the first calendar quarter of 2022, on broad-based economic strength, and momentum also looks strong heading into the second calendar quarter. TD Economics estimates that real GDP will advance at an approximate 5% annualized pace over the first half of calendar 2022, outperforming U.S. growth. The Canadian labour market has been similarly strong, with the unemployment rate falling to a near 50-year low of 5.2% in April 2022. The labour force continues to make strides, with the participation rate of 15- to 64-year-olds near an all-time high. As in the United States, demand for labour is strong across industries, and wage growth is expected to push higher in the coming months. Canadian home sales fell 12.6% month-on-month in April, as activity continued to moderate after a period of strength through the winter. However, the inventory of homes for sale remains low, keeping markets in sellers’ territory. The average home price in Canada fell 3.8% month-on-month in April, likely reflecting in part a compositional shift towards lower priced properties. As the Bank of Canada continues to raise rates, the corresponding increase in mortgage rates is expected to slow housing demand over the next year. Housing prices are likely to continue to soften in the second half of the year, but remain above pre-pandemic levels. Tight supply relative to strong population growth fundamentals is expected to mitigate the risk of a large retreat. Page 12",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second-quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial and economic insights:\n\n1. **Income Taxes**: The bank's effective income tax rate on a reported basis was 21.7% for the current quarter, consistent with the same quarter last year, with slight variations due to business mix. The adjusted effective income tax rate was 21.6%, slightly lower than the previous quarter.\n\n2. **Proposed Tax Measures**: The Canadian Federal Budget proposes new taxes on bank and life insurer groups, including a 15% Canada Recovery Dividend on 2021 taxable income above $1 billion and a 1.5% permanent tax on income above $100 million. These measures, if enacted, will increase tax liabilities.\n\n3. **Global Economic Outlook**: The global economic outlook for 2022 has been downgraded due to the Russia-Ukraine war, which has increased commodity prices and inflation. Central banks are expected to raise interest rates to control inflation, with uncertain impacts on economic growth.\n\n4. **U.S. Economy**: The U.S. economy contracted by 1.4% annualized in Q1 2022, primarily due to net exports and inventory issues, while consumer spending and business investment remained strong. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to combat inflation, with further hikes expected.\n\n5. **Canadian Economy**: Canada's economy showed strong growth in Q1 2022, with a robust labor market and low unemployment. However, housing sales and prices have started to moderate, influenced by rising interest rates, though prices remain above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOverall, the report indicates stable tax rates for TD Bank, potential impacts from new Canadian tax proposals, and a mixed economic outlook with inflationary pressures and interest rate hikes in both the U.S. and Canada."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Consumer Price Index inflation is lower in Canada than in the United States, but reached 6.8% in April 2022, the highest rate since the Goods and Services Tax was introduced in 1991. Given Canada’s strong economic momentum and broadening in inflation pressures recently, inflation is likely to ease only slightly through 2022 under similar dynamics as described for the U.S. The Bank of Canada raised its overnight interest rate to 1.00% in April and stated that it will start reducing the size of its balance sheet. TD Economics expects the overnight rate to rise by 50 bps in June and again in July, bringing the overnight rate to 2.50% by the end of the year. With interest rates set to increase by a similar amount in Canada and the United States, the Canadian dollar is expected to remain in a range of 75-80 U.S. cents over the next two years. For management reporting purposes, the Bank reports its results under three key business segments: Canadian Retail, which includes the results of the personal and commercial banking, wealth, and insurance businesses; U.S. Retail, which includes the results of the personal and business banking operations, wealth management services, and the Bank’s investment in Schwab; and Wholesale Banking. The Bank’s other activities are grouped into the Corporate segment. Results of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the Bank measures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments, the Bank indicates that the measure is adjusted. For further details, refer to the “How We Performed” section of this document, the “Business Focus” section in the Bank’s 2021 MD&A, and Note 29 of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2021. PCL related to performing (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and impaired (Stage 3) financial assets, loan commitments, and financial guarantees is recorded within the respective segment. Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt income, including certain dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking’s results are reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the quarter was $34 million, compared with $38 million in the prior quarter and $37 million in the second quarter last year. Share of net income from investment in Schwab is reported in the U.S. Retail segment. Amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction are recorded in the Corporate segment.

Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q2 2021 Canadian Retail net income for the quarter was $2,236 million, an increase of $54 million, or 2%, compared with the second quarter last year, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses, insurance claims, and PCL. The annualized ROE for the quarter was 44.6%, compared with 51.3% in the second quarter last year. Canadian Retail revenue is derived from the personal and business banking, wealth, and insurance businesses. Revenue for the quarter was $6,623 million, an increase of $561 million, or 9%, compared with the second quarter last year. Net interest income was $3,148 million, an increase of $275 million, or 10%, compared with the second quarter last year, primarily reflecting volume growth. Average loan volumes increased $43 billion, or 9%, reflecting 8% growth in personal loans and 16% growth in business loans. Average deposit volumes increased $37 billion, or 8%, reflecting 7% growth in personal deposits, 10% growth in business deposits, and 10% growth in wealth deposits. Net interest margin was 2.62%, an increase of 1 basis point, as higher margin on deposits reflecting the rising interest rate environment, was partially offset by lower margin on loans. Non-interest income was $3,475 million, an increase of $286 million, or 9%, reflecting prior year premium rebates for customers in the insurance business, and higher fee-based revenue in the banking and wealth businesses, partially offset by lower transaction revenue in the wealth business, and a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in insurance claims. ssets under administration (AUA) were $537 billion as at April 30, 2022, an increase of $23 billion, or 4%, and assets under management (AUM) were $411 billion as at April 30, 2022, an increase of $14 billion, or 4%, compared with the second quarter last year, both reflecting net asset growth. PCL was $60 million, higher by $97 million compared with the second quarter last year. PCL – impaired for the quarter was $163 million, a decrease of $28 million, or 15%, largely related to improved credit conditions. PCL – performing was a recovery of $103 million, compared with a recovery of $228 million in the Page 13",

This is expected to keep the Canadian dollar within 75-80 U.S. cents over the next two years.\n\n2. **Canadian Retail Performance**: The Canadian Retail segment reported a net income of $2,236 million for Q2 2022, a 2% increase from the previous year, driven by higher revenue but offset by increased non-interest expenses, insurance claims, and provisions for credit losses (PCL). Revenue rose by 9% to $6,623 million, with net interest income up 10% due to volume growth in loans and deposits.\n\n3. **Assets and Margins**: Assets under administration and management grew by 4% each, reflecting net asset growth. The net interest margin slightly increased to 2.62%, influenced by higher deposit margins in a rising interest rate environment.\n\n4. **Provisions for Credit Losses (PCL)**: Total PCL was $60 million, an increase of $97 million from the previous year, with impaired PCL decreasing due to improved credit conditions, while performing PCL saw a reduced recovery.\n\n5. **Segment Reporting**: TD Bank reports results across Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking segments, with adjustments for performance evaluation. The U.S. Retail segment includes income from its investment in Schwab, while the Corporate segment handles amortization and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction.\n\nOverall, TD Bank's Canadian Retail segment showed revenue growth and increased loan and deposit volumes, despite challenges from inflation and rising interest rates."

Insurance claims and related expenses for the quarter were $592 million, an increase of $151 million, or 34%, compared with the second quarter last year reflecting higher current year claims, partially offset by the favourable impact of a higher discount rate which resulted in a similar decrease in fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income. Non-interest expenses for the quarter were $2,932 million, an increase of $243 million, or 9%, compared with the second quarter last year, reflecting higher spend supporting business growth, including technology and marketing costs, higher employee-related expenses and variable compensation.

Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q1 2022 Canadian Retail net income for the quarter was $2,236 million, a decrease of $18 million, or 1%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting lower revenue and higher non-interest expenses and PCL, partially offset by lower insurance claims. The annualized ROE for the quarter was 44.6%, compared with 44.8%, in the prior quarter. Revenue decreased $95 million, or 1%, compared with the prior quarter. Net interest income increased $63 million, or 2%, reflecting higher margins and volume growth, partially offset by the effect of fewer days in the second quarter.

Average deposit volumes increased $6 billion, or 1%, reflecting 2% growth in personal deposits and a 5% increase in wealth deposits. Net interest margin was 2.62%, an increase of 9 bps, primarily due to higher margin on deposits, reflecting the rising interest rate environment. Non-interest income decreased $158 million, or 4%, reflecting a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in insurance claims, and lower fee-based revenue in the banking and wealth businesses. AUA decreased $20 billion, or 4%, and AUM decreased $18 billion, or 4%, compared with the prior quarter, both reflecting market depreciation, partially offset by net asset growth.

Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.05%, an increase of 2 bps. Insurance claims and related expenses for the quarter decreased $164 million, or 22%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting the favourable impact of a higher discount rate which resulted in a similar decrease in fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income, more favourable prior years’ claims development, and lower current year claims. Non-interest expenses increased $63 million, or 2%, compared with the prior quarter reflecting higher technology and marketing costs. The efficiency ratio was 44.3%, compared with 42.7%, in the prior quarter.

Average deposit volumes increased $38 billion, or 9%, reflecting 7% growth in personal deposits, 11% growth in business deposits, and 9% growth in wealth deposits. Net interest margin was 2.58%, a decrease of 5 bps, primarily reflecting lower margin on loans and lower mortgage prepayment revenue, partially offset by higher margin on deposits, reflecting the rising interest rate environment. Non-interest income increased $552 million, or 8%, reflecting higher fee-based revenue in the banking and wealth business, prior year insurance premium rebates for customers and higher insurance volumes, partially offset by lower transaction revenue in the wealth business, and a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in insurance claims. PCL was $93 million, a decrease of $12 million, compared with the same period last year. PCL – impaired was $313 million, a decrease of $45 million, or 13%, largely related to improved credit conditions.

Insurance claims and related expenses were $1,348 million, an increase of $127 million, or 10%, compared with the same period last year, reflecting higher current year claims and more severe weather-related events, partially offset by the favourable impact of a higher discount rate which resulted in a similar decrease in fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income. Non-interest expenses were $5,801 million, an increase of $458 million, or 9%, compared with the same period last year, reflecting higher spend supporting business growth, including technology and marketing costs, higher employee-related expenses and variable compensation.

In addition, the value of tax-exempt interest income is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. Net interest income and average interest-earning assets used in the calculation ar e non-GAAP financial measures. Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q2 2021 U.S. Retail reported net income for the quarter was $1,367 million (US$1,079 million), an increase of $51 million (US$32 million), or 4% (3% in U.S. dollars) compared with the second quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, net income for the quarter was $1,198 million (US$946 million), a decrease of $118 million (US$101 million), or 9% (10% in U.S. dollars). The reported and adjusted annualized ROE for the quarter was 14.2% and 12.5%, respectively, compared with 13.9% in the second quarter last year. U.S. Retail net income includes contributions from the U.S. Retail Bank and the Bank’s investment in Schwab. Reported net income for the quarter from the U.S. Retail Bank and the Bank’s investment in Schwab was $1,143 million (US$902 million) and $224 million (US$177 million), respectively. On an adjusted basis for the quarter, the U.S. Retail Bank’s contributed net income was $974 million (US$769 million). The contribution from Schwab of US$177 million decreased US$17 million, or 9%, primarily reflecting lower trading revenue. U.S. Retail Bank reported net income was US$902 million, an increase of US$49 million, or 6%, primarily reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by a lower recovery of PCL. U.S. Retail Bank adjusted net income was US$769 million, a decrease of US$84 million, or 10%, primarily reflecting a lower recovery of PCL, partially offset by higher revenue. U.S. Retail Bank revenue is derived from the personal and business banking and wealth management businesses. Reported revenue for the quarter was US$2,323 million, an increase of US$247 million, or 12%, compared with the second quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, revenue increased US$70 million, or 3%. Net interest income of US$1,641 million, increased US$93 million, or 6%, largely driven by the benefit of higher personal and business deposit volumes and margins combined with increased earnings on the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower income from PPP loan forgiveness, and lower sweep deposit balances. Net interest margin of 2.21%, increased 6 bps, as higher margin on deposits reflecting the rising interest rate environment and increased earnings on the investment portfolio was partially o ffset by negative balance sheet mix and lower income from PPP loan forgiveness. Reported non-interest income of US$682 million increased US$154 million, or 29%, compared with the second quarter last year, primarily reflecting an insurance recovery related to litigation and Page 15",
        "summary": "In the second quarter of 2022, TD Bank Group reported improved credit conditions but faced elevated economic uncertainty. The total provision for credit losses (PCL) as a percentage of credit volume increased slightly to 0.05%. Insurance claims rose by 34% year-over-year due to higher current year claims, though this was partially offset by a favorable discount rate impact. Non-interest expenses increased by 9% due to higher spending on business growth, technology, and employee-related costs. The efficiency ratio remained stable at 44.3%.\n\nCanadian Retail net income decreased slightly by 1% from the previous quarter, with revenue down by 1% and non-interest expenses up by 2%. Net interest income rose by 2% due to higher margins and volume growth. Average loan and deposit volumes increased, reflecting growth in both personal and business sectors. Non-interest income fell by 4% due to decreased investment values and lower fee-based revenue.\n\nFor the U.S. Retail segment, reported net income increased by 4% year-over-year, driven by higher revenue and contributions from the U.S. Retail Bank and Schwab investment. However, adjusted net income decreased by 9% due to a lower recovery of PCL. Revenue growth was supported by higher deposit volumes and margins, despite lower income from PPP loan forgiveness. Non-interest income rose significantly due to an insurance recovery related to litigation.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group experienced growth in loan and deposit volumes, but faced challenges from increased expenses and economic uncertainties."

Trading-related revenue (TEB) is a non -GAAP financial measure. Refer to “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in the “How We Performed” section and the Glossary of this document for additional information about this metric. 2 Includes gross loans and bankers’ acceptances relating to Wholesale Banking, excluding letters of credit, cash collateral, cre dit default swaps, and allowance for credit losses. 3 Capital allocated to the business segment was increased to 10.5% CET1 Capital effective the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with 9% in the prior year. Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q2 2021 Wholesale Banking net income for the quarter was $359 million, a decrease of $24 million, or 6%, compared with the second quarter last year, reflecting higher non-interest expenses and a lower PCL recovery, partially offset by higher revenues. Wholesale Banking revenue is derived primarily from capital markets and corporate and investment banking services provided to corporate, government, and institutional clients. Wholesale Banking generates revenue from corporate lending, advisory, underwriting, sales, trading and research, client securitization, trade finance, cash management, prime services, and trade execution services. Revenue for the quarter was $1,250 million, an increase of $93 million, or 8%, compared with the second quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher trading-related revenue, partially offset by lower underwriting fees. PCL for the quarter was a recovery of $9 million, compared with a recovery of $63 million in the second quarter last year. PCL – impaired was a recovery of $1 million. PCL – performing was a recovery of $8 million, compared with a recovery of $75 million in the prior year. Non-interest expenses were $776 million, an increase of $71 million, or 10%, compared with the second quarter last year, primarily reflecting the continued investments in Wholesale Banking’s U.S. dollar strategy, including the hiring of banking, sales and trading, and technology professionals, and the acquisition of TD Securities Automated Trading (previously Headlands Tech Global Markets, LLC). Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q1 2022 Wholesale Banking net income for the quarter was $359 million, a decrease of $75 million, or 17%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting lower revenue and higher non-interest expenses. Revenue for the quarter decreased $96 million, or 7%, primarily reflecting lower trading-related revenue, loan fees and underwriting fees. PCL for the quarter was a recovery of $9 million, compared with a recovery of $5 million in the prior quarter. PCL – impaired was a recovery of $1 million. PCL – performing was a recovery of $8 million. Non-interest expenses for the quarter increased $12 million, or 2%, primarily reflecting volume related and other fees, partially offset by lower variable compensation. Year-to-date comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q2 2021 Wholesale Banking net income for the six months ended April 30, 2022 was $793 million, a decrease of $27 million, or 3%, compared with the same period last year, reflecting higher non-interest expenses and a lower PCL recovery, partially offset by higher revenues. Revenue was $2,596 million, an increase of $129 million, or 5%, compared with the same period last year, reflecting higher trading-related revenue, prime services revenue, and transaction banking revenue, partially offset by lower underwriting fees. PCL was a recovery of $14 million, compared with a recovery of $43 million in the same period last year. PCL – impaired was a recovery of $5 million, lower by $27 million. PCL – performing was a recovery of $9 million, compared with a recovery of $65 million in the same period last year. Page 17",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Non-Interest Income and Loan Volumes**: Non-interest income decreased by 4% due to lower gains on mortgage loan sales, despite growth in fee income from increased customer activity. Average loan volumes decreased by 4%, with personal loans up 4% and business loans down 11%, excluding PPP loans.\n\n2. **Deposits and Assets**: Average deposit volumes increased by 3%, driven by a 12% rise in personal deposits and a 7% increase in business deposits. Assets under administration (AUA) grew by 19%, while assets under management (AUM) decreased by 16% due to market depreciation and net asset outflows.\n\n3. **Provision for Credit Losses (PCL)**: PCL was a recovery of US$15 million, down from US$173 million the previous year, reflecting improved credit conditions but offset by economic uncertainty.\n\n4. **Expenses and Efficiency**: Non-interest expenses rose by 2%, mainly due to higher employee-related costs and business investments. The efficiency ratio improved to 55.5% from 61.0% the previous year.\n\n5. **U.S. Retail Banking**: Reported net income increased by 14% year-over-year, with higher revenue partially offset by increased PCL. Net interest income rose by 6%, driven by higher deposit volumes and margins. Non-interest income grew by 17% due to an insurance recovery and fee income growth.\n\n6. **Wholesale Banking**: Net income decreased by 6% year-over-year due to higher non-interest expenses and lower PCL recovery, despite an 8% increase in revenue from higher trading-related income.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group experienced growth in deposits and personal loans, improved efficiency, and faced challenges with lower gains on mortgage sales and increased expenses."

Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q2 2021 Corp orate segment’s reported net loss for the quarter was $151 million, compared with a reported net loss of $186 million in the second quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower net corporate expenses and lower amortization of intangibles. Net corporate expenses decreased $25 million compared to the same quarter last year. The adjusted net loss for the quarter was $79 million, compared with an adjusted net loss of $106 million in the second quarter last year. Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q1 2022 Corp orate segment’s reported net loss for the quarter was $151 million, compared with a reported net loss of $227 million in the prior quarter. The quarter-over­ quarter decrease reflects a higher contribution from other items, lower acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction, and lower net corporate expenses. The increase in other items primarily reflects higher revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities this quarter. Net corporate expenses decreased $7 million compared to the prior quarter. The adjusted net loss for the quarter was $79 million, compared with an adjusted net loss of $127 million in the prior quarter. Year-to-date comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q2 2021 Corp orate segment’s reported net loss for the six months ended April 30, 2022 was $378 million, compared with a reported net loss of $383 million in the same period last year. The $5 million decrease primarily reflects lower net corporate expenses and lower amortization of intangibles, partially offset by a lower contribution of other items and higher acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction. Other items decreased $45 million, largely reflecting lower revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities. Net corporate expenses decreased $39 million compared to the same period last year. Adjusted net loss for the six months ended April 30, 2022 was $206 million, compared with an adjusted net loss of $200 million in the same period last year.

The impact of foreign exchange translation from the depreciation in the Canadian dollar increased total assets by $29 billion, or approximately 2%. The increase in total assets reflects debt securities at amortized cost (DSAC), net of allowance for credit losses of $48 billion, derivatives of $44 billion, loans, net of allowances for loan losses of $42 billion, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements of $5 billion, non-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) of $2 billion and other assets of $2 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $32 billion, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) of $10 billion, trading loans, securities, and other of $3 billion and investment in Schwab of $1 billion. Cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks decreased $32 billion primarily reflecting cash management activities. Trading loans, securities, and other decreased $3 billion primarily reflecting a decrease in government-related securities and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Non-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss increased $2 billion reflecting new investments. Derivative assets increased $44 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange, equity and interest rate contracts. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income decreased $10 billion primarily reflecting maturities and sales, partially offset by new investments. Debt securities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses increased $48 billion reflecting new investments and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by maturities. Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements increased $5 billion primarily reflecting an increase in volume and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased $42 billion reflecting volume growth in business and government loans, real estate secured lending, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Investment in Schwab decreased $1 billion primarily reflecting the impact of the Bank’s share of Schwab’s other comprehensive loss. Other assets increased $2 billion primarily reflecting an increase in current income tax receivable, accounts receivable and other and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by a decrease in amounts receivable from brokers, dealers and clients reflecting lower volumes of pending trades. Total liabilities were $1,726 billion as at April 30, 2022, an increase of $97 billion, or 6%, from October 31, 2021. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the depreciation in the Canadian dollar increased t otal liabilities by $30 billion, or a pproximately 2%. The increase in total liabilities reflects deposits of $58 billion, derivatives of $31 billion, financial liabilities designated at FVTPL of $15 billion, and other liabilities of $7 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements of $11 billion and trading deposits of $3 billion. Page 20 TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Trading deposits decreased $3 billion primarily reflecting maturities. Derivative liabilities increased $31 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss increased $15 billion primarily reflecting new issuances and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by maturities. Deposits increased $58 billion reflecting volume growth in business and government deposits, personal deposits, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements decreased $11 billion reflecting a decrease in volume, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Other liabilities increased $7 billion primarily reflecting an increase in obligations related to securities sold short. Equity was $99 billion as at April 30, 2022, flat from October 31, 2021. The increase in retained earnings and preferred shares and other equity instruments was offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income is primarily driven by losses in cash flow hedges and from the Bank’s share of the other comprehensive loss from investment in Schwab, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange tr anslation. Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q2 2021 Gross impaired loans excluding acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans were $2,397 million as at April 30, 2022, a decrease of $406 million, or 14%, compared with the second quarter last year. Canadian Retail gross impaired loans decreased $229 million, or 20%, compared with the second quarter last year, reflecting improved credit conditions and largely recorded in the real estate secured lending and commercial lending portfolios. U.S. Retail gross impaired loans decreased $115 million, or 7%, compared with the second quarter last year, reflecting improved credit conditions and largely recorded in the commercial lending portfolio. Wholesale gross impaired loans decreased $62 million or 90%, compared with the second quarter last year, reflecting resolutions outpacing formations. Net impaired loans were $1,695 million as at April 30, 2022, a decrease of $374 million, or 18%, compared with the second quarter last year. The allowance for credit losses of $6,917 million as at April 30, 2022 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $707 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,458 million and Stage 1 allowance of $2,745 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $7 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses decreased $59 million, or 8%, reflecting improved credit conditions, and largely recorded in the U.S. Retail and Wholesale Banking segments. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses decreased $1,000 million, or 14%, reflecting releases in all segments, largely related to improved credit conditions, including a more favourable outlook. The allowance change included a decrease of $194 million attributable to the retailer program partners’ share of the U.S. strategic cards portfolio. The allowance for debt securities increased by $1 million compared with the second quarter last year. Forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables deemed to be predictive of expected credit losses (ECLs) based on the Bank’s experience, is used to determine ECL scenarios and associated probability weights to establish the probability-weighted ECLs. Each quarter, all base forecast macroeconomic variables are refreshed, resulting in new upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios. The probability weightings assigned to each ECL scenario are also reviewed each quarter and updated as required, as part of the Bank’s ECL governance process. As a result of periodic reviews and quarterly updates, the allowance for credit losses may be revised to reflect updates in loss estimates based on the Bank’s recent loss experience and its forward-looking views. The Bank periodically reviews the methodology and has performed certain additional qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s second quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on forward-looking information. The probability-weighted allowance for credit losses reflects the Bank’s forward-looking views. To the extent that certain anticipated effects cannot be fully incorporated into quantitative models, management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in determining the amount of ECLs. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and the allowance for credit losses will be updated in future quarters as additional information becomes available. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s second quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Bank calculates allowances for ECLs on debt securities measured at amortized cost and FVOCI. The Bank has $379 billion in such debt securities, all of which are performing (Stage 1 and 2) and none are impaired (Stage 3). The allowance for credit losses on DSAC and debt securities at FVOCI was $1 million and $6 million, respectively. Quarterly comparison – Q2 2022 vs. Q1 2022 Gross impaired loans excluding ACI loans decreased $163 million, or 6%, compared with the prior quarter, reflected in the U.S. commercial lending portfolio, largely related to resolutions of government guaranteed PPP loans, and in the Canadian and U.S. consumer lending portfolios. Impaired loans net of allowance decreased $185 million, or 10%, compared with the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses of $6,917 million as at April 30, 2022 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $707 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,458 million and Stage 1 allowance of $2,745 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $7 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $21 million, or 3%, compared with the prior quarter. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses decreased $252 million, or 4%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting improved credit conditions, partially offset by elevated economic uncertainty. The allowance for debt securities was $7 million, consistent with the prior quarter. For further details on loans, impaired loans, allowance for credit losses, and on the Bank’s use of forward-looking information and macroeconomic variables in determining its allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 6 of the Bank’s second quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Non-Interest Expenses**: Increased by 9% to $1,540 million, primarily due to investments in the U.S. dollar strategy and the acquisition of TD Securities Automated Trading.\n\n2. **Net Income and Loss**: The corporate segment reported a net loss of $151 million for Q2 2022, an improvement from a $186 million loss in Q2 2021, due to lower net corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles. The adjusted net loss was $79 million, down from $106 million in the previous year.\n\n3. **Revenue and Expenses**: Total revenue for Q2 2022 was $11,263 million, with net interest income and non-interest income showing slight increases. Non-interest expenses rose to $6,033 million.\n\n4. **Assets and Liabilities**: Total assets increased by 6% to $1,825 billion, driven by growth in debt securities, derivatives, and loans. Total liabilities also rose by 6% to $1,726 billion, with significant increases in deposits and derivatives.\n\n5. **Credit Losses and Impaired Loans**: Gross impaired loans decreased by 14% year-over-year, reflecting improved credit conditions. The allowance for credit losses was $6,917 million, with a decrease in Stage 1 and 2 allowances due to improved credit conditions.\n\n6. **Equity**: Remained stable at $99 billion, with changes in retained earnings and other comprehensive income offsetting each other.\n\nOverall, the report indicates a focus on strategic investments and improved credit conditions, contributing to a reduction in net losses and an increase in total assets and liabilities."

Real Estate Secured Lending Retail real estate secured lending includes mortgages and lines of credit to North American consumers to satisfy financing needs including home purchases and refinancing. While the Bank retains first lien on the majority of properties held as security, there is a small portion of loans with second liens, but most of these are behind a TD mortgage that is in first position. In Canada, credit policies are designed so that the combined exposure of all uninsured facilities on one property does not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination. Lending at a higher loan-to-value ratio is permitted by legislation but requires default insurance. This insurance is contractual coverage for the life of eligible facilities and protects the Bank’s real estate secured lending portfolio against potential losses caused by borrowers’ default. The Bank may also purchase default insurance on lower loan-to-value ratio loans. The insurance is provided by either government-backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers. In the U.S., for residential mortgage originations, mortgage insurance is usually obtained from either government- backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers when the loan-to-value exceeds 80% of the collateral value at origination. The Bank regularly performs stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio as part of its overall stress testing program. This is done with a view to determine the extent to which the portfolio would be vulnerable to a severe downturn in economic conditions. The effect of severe changes in house prices, interest rates, and unemployment levels are among the factors considered when assessing the impact on credit losses and the Bank’s overall profitability. A variety of portfolio segments, including dwelling type and geographical regions, are examined during the exercise to determine whether specific vulnerabilities exist.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second-quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Impaired Loans**: The gross impaired loans decreased from $2,803 million in April 2021 to $2,397 million in April 2022. This reduction is due to factors such as loans being transferred to performing status, net repayments, and amounts written off.\n\n2. **Allowance for Credit Losses**: The total allowance for credit losses decreased from $7,975 million in April 2021 to $6,917 million in April 2022. This includes allowances for both on-balance sheet loans and off-balance sheet instruments.\n\n3. **Net Impaired Loans**: The net impaired loans, after accounting for allowances, decreased from $2,069 million in April 2021 to $1,695 million in April 2022. The net impaired loans as a percentage of net loans also decreased from 0.28% to 0.22%.\n\n4. **Real Estate Secured Lending**: The bank's Canadian real estate secured lending portfolio increased from $333,608 million in October 2021 to $347,914 million in April 2022. The bank maintains strict credit policies, ensuring that uninsured facilities do not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination, with default insurance required for higher loan-to-value ratios.\n\n5. **Stress Testing**: TD Bank conducts regular stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio to assess vulnerability to economic downturns, considering factors like house prices, interest rates, and unemployment levels.\n\nOverall, the report indicates a positive trend in reducing impaired loans and maintaining a robust real estate lending portfolio with prudent risk management practices."

Capital requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are commonly referred to as Basel III. Under Basel III, Total Capital consists of three components, namely CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III introduced a non-risk sensitive leverage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage exposure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. TD continues to manage its regulatory capital in accordance with the Basel III Capital Framework as discussed in the “Capital Position” section of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III OSFI’s Capital Adequacy Requirements guideline details how the Basel III capital rules apply to Canadian banks. Other requirements, in addition to those described in “OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III” section of Bank’s 2021 Annual Report, are noted below. On March 13, 2020, as part of its COVID-19 response, OSFI announced that the Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB), previously set to increase to 2.25% effective April 30, 2020, was being lowered to 1.00% effective immediately. On June 17, 2021, OSFI announced that the DSB would increase to 2.50% of total RWA, effective October 31, 2021. On December 10, 2021, OSFI announced that the DSB will remain at 2.50% of total RWA. The Bank maintained its Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) status when the Financial Stability Board published the 2021 list of G-SIBs on November 23, 2021. As a result of the designation, the Bank continues to be subject to an additional loss absorbency requirement (CET1 as a percentage of RWA) of 1%. As the Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) surcharge is currently equivalent to the 1% G-SIB requirement, the Bank’s G-SIB designation has no additional impact on the Bank’s minimum CET1 regulatory requirements. On September 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guideline. Under this guideline, the Bank was required to meet supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.0% of RWA, inclusive of the 2.50% DSB, and TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75% by November 1, 2021. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio. The table below summarizes OSFI’s current regulatory minimum capital and TLAC ratios for the Bank. Minimum Capital Conservation Buffer D-SIB / G-SIB Surcharge1 Pillar 1 Regulatory target2 DSB3 Pillar 1 & 2 regulatory target CET1 4.5 % 2.5 % 1.0 % 8.0 % 2.5 % 10.5 % Tier 1 6.0 2.5 1.0 9.5 2.5 12.0 Total Capital 8.0 2.5 1.0 11.5 2.5 14.0 TLAC 18.0 2.5 1.0 21.5 2.5 24.0 1 The higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharge applies. The D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the Bank’s 1% G-SIB additi onal common equity requirement. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%. 2 The Bank’s countercyclical buffer requirement is 0% as of April 30, 2022. 3 The DSB increased to 2.5%, from 1.0%, of total RWA effective October 31, 2021.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second-quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Real Estate Secured Lending**: The report provides detailed figures on residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit in Canada and the United States. As of April 30, 2022, the majority of TD's real estate secured lending in Canada is uninsured, with Ontario having the largest share. The total real estate secured lending in Canada is $274.2 billion, with $215.98 billion uninsured.\n\n2. **Amortization Periods**: The report outlines the distribution of residential mortgages by remaining amortization periods. In Canada, the majority of mortgages have amortization periods between 20 to 30 years.\n\n3. **Loan-to-Value Ratios**: The average loan-to-value ratios for newly originated and acquired residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit are provided. The overall loan-to-value ratio in Canada is 66%, with slight variations across regions.\n\n4. **Sovereign Risk Exposure**: TD Bank's direct credit exposures outside Canada and the U.S. are detailed, with significant exposure in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Asia. The total net exposure as of April 30, 2022, is $125.47 billion.\n\n5. **Regulatory Capital and TLAC**: The report discusses TD's compliance with Basel III capital requirements, including the Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guidelines. The DSB is set at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, and the bank maintains its Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) status, which requires an additional 1% CET1 capital.\n\nOverall, the report provides a comprehensive overview of TD Bank's real estate lending, international exposure, and regulatory capital compliance."

As noted above, the Bank is required to meet a supervisory TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75%. Effective January 1, 2013, all newly issued non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments must include non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) provisions to qualify as regulatory capital. NVCC provisions require the conversion of non-common capital instruments into a variable number of common shares of the Bank upon the occurrence of a trigger event. A trigger event is defined as an event where OSFI determines that the Bank is, or is about to become, non-viable and that after conversion of all non-common capital instruments, the viability of the Bank is expected to be restored, or if the Bank has accepted or agreed to accept a capital injection or equivalent support from a federal or provincial government of Canada without which the Bank would have been determined by OSFI to be non­ viable. Non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments issued prior to January 1, 2013, which did not include NVCC provisions were non-qualifying capital instruments and subject to a phase-out period which began in 2013 and ended on November 1, 2021. In fiscal 2020, OSFI introduced a number of measures to support D-SIBs’ ability to supply credit to the economy during an expected period of disruption related to COVID-19 and market conditions. These measures, and subsequent guidance issued by OSFI, are described in the “OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III” section of Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. Page 25",

As at April 30, 2022, the Bank’s CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital, and risk-based TLAC ratios were 14.7%, 15.9%, 18.5% and 30.4%, respectively. The Bank’s CET1 Capital ratio was lower compared to October 31, 2021 due to RWA growth in the Wholesale Banking and Canadian Retail segments, common shares repurchased, unrealized losses on FVOCI securities, and the reduction in the scaling factor related to OSFI’s transition arrangements for ECL provisioning from Page 26",

Key insights include:\n\n1. **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital**: As of April 30, 2022, CET1 Capital was $71,866 million, slightly down from $69,937 million in October 2021, primarily due to regulatory adjustments and changes in retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\n2. **Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital**: Tier 1 Capital increased to $77,819 million, while Tier 2 Capital was $12,452 million. Total Capital stood at $90,271 million.\n\n3. **Capital Ratios**: The CET1 Capital ratio was 14.7%, down from 15.2% in October 2021, due to growth in risk-weighted assets (RWA) in the Wholesale Banking and Canadian Retail segments, share repurchases, and unrealized losses on FVOCI securities. The Tier 1 Capital ratio was 15.9%, and the Total Capital ratio was 18.5%.\n\n4. **Leverage Ratio**: The leverage ratio was 4.3%, indicating the bank's capital adequacy relative to its total exposure.\n\nOverall, the report highlights a slight decrease in CET1 Capital ratio due to increased RWA and other factors, while maintaining strong capital levels across Tier 1 and Tier 2 categories."

The decrease was partially offset by organic capital growth and a decrease in the threshold deduction for non-significant investment in financial entities. As at April 30, 2022, the Bank’s Leverage and TLAC Leverage ratios were 4.3% and 8.1%, respectively. The decrease in the Bank’s Leverage ratio from 4.8% as at October 31, 2021 primarily reflects the expiration of the exclusion of sovereign-issued securities from the leverage ratio measure on December 31, 2021, partially offset by organic capital growth. Future Regulatory Capital Developments Future regulatory capital developments, in addition to those described in the “Future Regulatory Capital Developments” section of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report, are noted below. On January 31, 2022, OSFI announced revised capital, leverage, liquidity and disclosure rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. The Leverage Requirements Guideline revisions include a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer in addition to the regulatory minimum requirement of 3.0%. This buffer will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio supervisory target of 6.75%. The revised rules are effective in the second quarter of 2023, with the exception of those related to market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk which are effective in 2024.

Thereafter, the dividend rate will reset every five years equal to the then five-year Government of Canada bond yield pl us 3.317%. The Series 27 Shares are redeemable by the Bank, subject to regulatory approval, at $1,000 per share during the period from October 2, 2027 to and including October 31, 2027, and during the period from October 1 to and including October 31 every 5th year thereafter. 3 For Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCNs), the number of shares/units represents the number of notes issued. 4 On November 1, 2021, TD Capital Trust IV redeemed all of the outstanding TD Capital Trust IV Notes – Series 2. On May 25, 2022, the Board approved a dividend in an amount of eighty nine cents (89 cents) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the Bank for the quarter ending July 31, 2022, payable on and after July 31, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 8, 2022. The Bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan for its common shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on common shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from the Bank’s treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion, or from the open market at market price. The Bank has determined that, beginning with the dividend approved on May 25, 2022 for the quarter ending July 31, 2022, and until further announcement, the Bank will issue the common shares from treasury and will apply a 2% discount to the average market price of such common shares. The Bank’s practice is that, in conjunction with the Bank’s dividend declaration announcements, the Bank will announce if a discount will apply to the average market price of common shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan for the declared dividend. On January 7, 2022, the Bank announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange and OSFI had approved the Bank’s previously announced normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to repurchase for cancellation up to 50 million of its common shares. During the three months ended April 30, 2022, the Bank repurchased 13.5 million common shares under the NCIB, at an average price of $105.95 per share, for a total amount of $1.4 billion, which represents a $1.3 billion premium over the share capital amount.

Concurrent with the announcement of the Bank’s acquisition of First Horizon on February 28, 2022, the Bank’s automatic share purchase plan established under its NCIB automatically terminated pursuant to its terms. All series of preferred shares – Class A include NVCC provisions. If a NVCC trigger event were to occur and excluding the Preferred Shares Series 26 issued with respect to LRCNs, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the respective series of preferred shares at the time of conversion, would be 960 million in aggregate. The LRCNs, by virtue of the recourse to the Preferred Shares Series 26, include NVCC provisions. For LRCNs, if a NVCC trigger were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Shares Series 26, would be 350 million. For NVCC subordinated notes and debentures, if a NVCC trigger event were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there is no accrued and unpaid interest on the respective subordinated notes and debentures, would be 3.2 billion in aggregate. In addition to the risks described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the Bank’s 2021 MD&A, there are numerous other risk factors, many of which are beyond the Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, that could cause the Bank’s results to differ significantly from its plans, objectives, and estimates or could impact the Bank’s reputation or sustainability of its business model. All forward-looking statements, including those in this MD&A, are, by their very nature, subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific, which may cause the Bank’s actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Some of these factors are discussed in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A and in this “Risk Factors and Management” section of this document, and others are noted in the “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section of this document. For a discussion of risk factors that could adversely affect the Bank’s financial results and condition, refer to the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A. The following risk factor supplements the “Impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic” risk factor described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A. Impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of additional variants that are potentially more contagious and/or more vaccine-resistant than current or past COVID-19 variants, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased levels of workforce absenteeism and disruption for the Bank and for its suppliers and other third parties upon which the Bank relies, which may increase operational and compliance risks for the Bank. Increased absenteeism and disruption may also increase the Bank’s exposure to the other risks described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A, including those set out in the “Impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic” risk factor. The following risk factor amends the ‘Ability to Attract, Develop, and Retain key Talent’ risk factor described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A. Ability to Attract, Develop, and Retain Key Talent The Bank’s future performance is dependent on the availability of qualified talent and the Bank’s ability to attract, develop, and retain key talent. The Bank’s management understands that the competition for talent continues to increase across geographies, industries, and emerging capabilities across a number of sectors including financial services. This competition has intensified and is expected to continue to intensify as a result of the impact of COVID-19, including as a result of remote work opportunities and relaxing geographic boundaries. This could result in increased attrition across organizations particularly in areas where core professional and specialized skills are required. Annually, the Bank undertakes a talent review process to assess critical capability requirements for all areas of the business. Through this process, an assessment of current executive leadership, technical and core capabilities, as well as talent development opportunities is completed against both near term and future business needs. The outcomes from the process inform plans at both the enterprise and business level to retain, develop, or acquire the talent which are then actioned throughout the course of the year. Although it is the goal of the Bank’s management resource policies and practices to attract, develop, and retain key talent employed by the Bank or an entity acquired by the Bank, the Bank may not be able to do so. The Bank continues to rely on the Bank’s annual talent review program as well as the Bank’s regular, effective management practices to proactively assess and address retention and recruitment risk and emphasize ongoing communication with talent to ensure appropriate responses on a case-by-case basis.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Growing profitability in financial results based on balanced revenue, expense and capital growth services involves selectively taking and managing risks within the Bank’s risk appetite. The Bank’s goal is to earn a stable and sustainable rate of return for every dollar of risk it takes, while putting significant emphasis on investing in its businesses to meet its future strategic objectives. The Bank’s businesses and operations are exposed to a broad number of risks that have been identified and defined in the Enterprise Risk Framework. The Bank’s tolerance to those risks is defined in the Enterprise Risk Appetite which has been developed within a comprehensive framework that takes into consideration current conditions in which the Bank operates and the impact that emerging risks will have on TD’s strategy and risk profile. The Bank’s risk appetite states that it takes risks required to build its business, but only if those risks: (1) fit the business strategy and can be understood and managed; (2) do not expose the enterprise to any significant single loss events; TD does not ‘bet the bank’ on any single acquisition, business, or product; and (3) do not risk harming the TD brand. Each business is responsible for setting and aligning its individual risk appetites with that of the enterprise based on a thorough examination of the specific risks to which it is exposed. The Bank considers it critical to regularly assess its operating environment and highlight top and emerging risks. These are risks with a potential to have a material effect on the Bank and where the attention of senior leaders is focused due to the potential magnitude or immediacy of their impact. Risks are identified, discussed, and actioned by senior leaders and reported quarterly to the Risk Committee. Specific plans to mitigate top and emerging risks are prepared, monitored, and adjusted as required. The Bank’s risk governance structure and risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. Additional information on risk factors can be found in this document and the 2021 MD&A under the heading “Risk Factors and Management”. For a complete discussion of the risk governance structure and the risk management approach, refer to the “Managing Risk” section in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. The shaded sections of this MD&A represent a discussion relating to market and liquidity risks and form an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended April 30, 2022. Gross credit risk exposure, also referred to as exposure at default (EAD), is the total amount the Bank is exposed to at the time of default of a loan and is measured before counterparty-specific provisions or write-offs. Gross credit risk exposure does not reflect the effects of credit risk mitigation (CRM) and includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. On-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of outstanding loans, acceptances, non-trading securities, derivatives, and certain other repo-style transactions. Off-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of undrawn commitments, guarantees, and certain other repo-style transactions. Gross credit risk exposures for the two approaches the Bank uses to measure credit risk are included in the following table.

The Enterprise Risk Framework and Risk Appetite guide the bank's risk-taking, ensuring risks align with business strategy, avoid significant single loss events, and protect the TD brand. Each business unit aligns its risk appetite with the enterprise's, focusing on top and emerging risks that could materially impact the bank. These risks are regularly assessed and reported to the Risk Committee, with mitigation plans in place.

        "chunk": "Calculating VaR The Bank computes total VaR on a daily basis by combining the General Market Risk (GMR) and Idiosyncratic Debt Specific Risk (IDSR) associated with the Bank’s trading positions. GMR is determined by creating a distribution of potential changes in the market value of the current portfolio using historical simulation. The Bank values the current portfolio using the market price and rate changes of the most recent 259 trading days for equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity products. GMR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. A one-day holding period is used for GMR calculation, which is scaled up to ten days for regulatory capital calculation purposes. IDSR measures idiosyncratic (single-name) credit spread risk for credit exposures in the trading portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. The IDSR model is based on the historical behaviour of five-year idiosyncratic credit spreads. Similar to GMR, IDSR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. IDSR is measured for a ten-day holding period. The following graph discloses daily one-day VaR usage and trading net revenue, reported on a taxable equivalent basis, within Wholesale Banking. Trading net revenue includes trading income and net interest income related to positions within the Bank’s market risk capital trading books. For the quarter ended April 30, 2022, there were 8 days of trading losses and trading net revenue was positive for 88% of the trading days, reflecting normal trading activity. Losses in the quarter did not exceed VaR on any trading day.

The Bank continuously improves its VaR methodologies and incorporates new risk measures in line with market conventions, industry best practices, and regulatory requirements. To mitigate some of the shortcomings of VaR, the Bank uses additional metrics designed for risk management and capital purposes. These include Stressed VaR, IRC, Stress Testing Framework, as well as limits based on the sensitivity to various market risk factors. Calculating Stressed VaR In addition to VaR, the Bank also calculates Stressed VaR, which includes Stressed GMR and Stressed IDSR. Stressed VaR is designed to measure the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices c ould have on the v alue of a p ortfolio over a specified p eriod o f stressed market conditions. Stressed VaR is determined using similar techniques and assumptions in GMR and IDSR VaR. However, instead of using the most recent 259 trading days (one year), the Bank uses a selected year of stressed market conditions. In the second quarter of 2022, Stressed VaR was calculated using the one-year period that includes the 2008 financial crisis. The appropriate historical one-year period to use for Stressed VaR is determined on a quarterly basis. Stressed VaR is a part of regulatory capital requirements. Calculating the Incremental Risk Charge The IRC is applied to all instruments in the trading book subject to migration and default risk. Migration risk represents the risk of changes in the credit ratings of the Bank’s exposures. TD applies a Monte Carlo simulation with a one-year horizon and a 99.9% confidence level to determine IRC, which is consistent with regulatory requirements. IRC is based on a “constant level of risk” assumption, which requires banks to assign a liquidity horizon to positions that are subject to IRC. IRC is a part of regulatory capital requirements.

Both are set to a threshold where losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. The bank also calculates Stressed VaR, using data from stressed market conditions like the 2008 financial crisis, and the Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) for migration and default risk, using a Monte Carlo simulation with a one-year horizon. The text notes that VaR has limitations, such as reliance on historical data and assumptions about liquidity, and the bank uses additional metrics like Stressed VaR and IRC to address these.

It is not meaningful to compute a diversification effect because the high and low may occur on different days for different risk types. Average VaR and Average Stressed VaR increased quarter-over-quarter due to widening of credit spreads, equity market volatility and changes in bond and interest rate positions. Average VaR also increased year-over-year due to increased market volatility in the recent period. Average Stressed VaR increased compared to same quarter last year due to widening of credit spreads as well as changes in bond and interest rate positions. Average IRC decreased both compared to last quarter and same quarter last year due to changes in bond positions. Validation of VaR Model The Bank uses a back-testing process to compare the actual and theoretical profit and losses to VaR to ensure that they are consistent with the statistical results of the VaR model. The theoretical profit or loss is generated using the daily price movements on the assumption that there is no change in the composition of the portfolio. Validation of the IRC model must follow a different approach since the one-year horizon and 99.9% confidence level preclude standard back-testing techniques. Instead, key parameters of the IRC model such as transition and correlation matrices are subject to independent validation by benchmarking against external study results or through analysis using internal or external data. Structural (Non-Trading) Interest Rate Risk The Bank’s structural interest rate risk arises from traditional personal and commercial banking activity and is generally the result of mismatches between the maturities and repricing dates of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. The measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book does not include exposures from TD’s Wholesale Banking or Insurance businesses. The primary measures for this risk are Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS). The EVE Sensitivity measures the impact of a specified interest rate shock to the change in the net present value of the Bank’s banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items. It reflects a measurement of the potential present value impact on shareholders’ equity without an assumed term profile for the management of the Bank’s own equity and excludes product margins. The NIIS measures the NII change over a twelve-month horizon for a specified change in interest rates for banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off- balance sheet items assuming a constant balance sheet over the period. The Bank’s Market Risk policy sets overall limits on the structural interest rate risk measures. These limits are periodically reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee. In addition to the Board policy limits, book-level risk limits are set for the Bank’s management of non-trading interest rate risk by Risk Management. Exposures against these limits are routinely monitored and reported, and breaches of the Board limits, if any, are escalated to both the Asset/Liability and Capital Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee. The following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rates on the EVE and NIIS measures. Interest rate floors are applied by currency to the decrease in rates such that they do not exceed expected lower bounds, with the most material currencies set to a floor of -25 bps.

As at April 30, 2022, an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase in interest rates would have had a negative impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,293 million, an increase of $9 million from last quarter, and a positive impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,545 million, a decrease of $455 million from last quarter. An immediate and sustained 100 bps decrease in interest rates would have had a positive impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,149 million, an increase of $606 million from last quarter, and a negative impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,574 million, an increase of $93 million from last quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in down shock EVE is primarily due to decreased sensitivity from loan optionality in the U.S. region. The quarter-over-quarter increase in down shock NII Sensitivity is primarily due to an increase in the effective shock given the increased level of rates and the measurement using a -25 bps floor, partially offset by hedging activity in Treasury, while the decrease in up shock NII Sensitivity is primarily attributed to Treasury hedging activity.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second-quarter 2022 report highlights several key insights regarding its portfolio market risk measures and structural interest rate risk. The report shows an increase in average Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Stressed VaR quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by widening credit spreads, equity market volatility, and changes in bond and interest rate positions. The Incremental Risk Capital Charge (IRC) decreased compared to both the previous quarter and the same quarter last year due to changes in bond positions. The bank employs a back-testing process to validate its VaR model and uses independent validation for its IRC model.\n\nRegarding structural interest rate risk, the report details the potential impact of a 100 basis point (bps) change in interest rates on the Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS). As of April 30, 2022, a 100 bps increase in rates would negatively impact EVE by $1,293 million and positively impact NII by $1,545 million. Conversely, a 100 bps decrease in rates would positively impact EVE by $1,149 million and negatively impact NII by $1,574 million. Changes in these sensitivities are attributed to loan optionality in the U.S. region and Treasury hedging activities. The bank's market risk policy sets limits on these measures, which are monitored and reported regularly."

Financial obligations can arise from deposit withdrawals, debt maturities, commitments to provide credit or liquidity support, or the need to pledge additional collateral. TD’S LIQUIDITY RISK APPETITE The Bank maintains a prudent and disciplined approach to managing its potential exposure to liquidity risk. The Bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under a combined bank-specific and market-wide stress scenario, and a minimum buffer over regulatory requirements prescribed by OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) guidelines. Under the LAR guidelines, Canadian banks are required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at the minimum of 100% other than during periods of financial stress and to maintain a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at the minimum of 100%. The Bank’s funding program emphasizes maximizing deposits as a core source of funding and having ready access to wholesale funding markets across diversified terms, funding types, and currencies that is designed to ensure low exposure to a sudden contraction of wholesale funding capacity and to minimize structural liquidity gaps. The Bank also maintains a contingency funding plan to enhance preparedness for recovery from potential liquidity stress events. The Bank’s strategies and actions comprise an integrated liquidity risk management program that is designed to ensure low exposure to liquidity risk and compliance with regulatory requirements. The Bank’s ALCO oversees the Bank’s liquidity risk management program. It ensures there are effective management structures and practices in place to properly measure and manage liquidity risk. The Global Liquidity & Funding Committee, a subcommittee of the ALCO comprised of senior management from Treasury and Balance Sheet Management (TBSM), Risk Management and Wholesale Banking, identifies and monitors the Bank’s liquidity risks. The management of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the SET member responsible for TBSM, while oversight and challenge is provided by the ALCO and independently by Risk Management. The Risk Committee regularly reviews the Bank’s liquidity position and approves the Bank’s Liquidity Risk Management Framework bi-annually and the related policies annually. The Bank has established TD Group US Holding LLC (TDGUS) as TD’s U.S. Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), as well as a Combined U.S. Operations (CUSO) reporting unit that consists of the IHC and TD’s U.S. branch and agency network. Both TDGUS and CUSO are managed to the U.S. Enhanced Prudential Standards liquidity requirements in addition to the Bank’s liquidity management framework. The Bank’s liquidity risk appetite and liquidity risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. For a complete discussion of liquidity risk, refer to the “Liquidity Risk” section in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. Liquid assets The unencumbered liquid assets the Bank holds to meet its liquidity requirements must be high-quality securities that the Bank believes can be monetized quickly in stress conditions with minimum loss in market value. The liquidity value of unencumbered liquid assets considers estimated market or trading depths, settlement timing, and/or other identified impediments to potential sale or pledging. Overall, the Bank expects any reduction in market value of its liquid asset portfolio to be modest given the underlying high credit quality and demonstrated liquidity. Assets held by the Bank to meet liquidity requirements are summarized in the following tables. The tables do not include assets held within the Bank’s insurance businesses as these are used to support insurance-specific liabilities and capital requirements. Page 33",
        "summary": "The text outlines TD Bank Group's approach to managing liquidity risk, which involves ensuring sufficient cash or collateral to meet financial obligations and the ability to raise funding or monetize assets without distress. The bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under stress scenarios and maintains a buffer over regulatory requirements set by OSFI's Liquidity Adequacy Requirements. TD emphasizes maximizing deposits and accessing diversified wholesale funding markets to minimize liquidity gaps. The bank has a contingency funding plan and an integrated liquidity risk management program overseen by the Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and the Global Liquidity & Funding Committee. TD's U.S. operations are managed according to U.S. Enhanced Prudential Standards. The bank holds high-quality, unencumbered liquid assets to meet liquidity needs, expecting minimal market value reduction due to their high credit quality. The bank's liquidity risk management approach remains consistent with its 2021 Annual Report."

Where a particular asset has been encumbered and TD has holdings of the asset both on-balance sheet and off- balance sheet, for the purpose of this disclosure, the on- and off-balance sheet holdings are encumbered in alignment with the business practice. 2 Assets received as collateral through off-balance transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, margin loans, and other client activity. 3 Represents assets that have been posted externally to support the Bank’s day-to-day operations, including securities financing transactions, clearing and payments, and derivative transactions. Also includes assets that have been pledged supporting Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) activity. 4 Assets supporting TD’s long-term funding activities, assets pledged against securitization liabilities, and assets held by con solidated securitization vehicles or in pools for covered bond issuance. 5 Assets that are considered readily available in their current legal form to generate funding or support collateral needs. This category includes reported FHLB assets that remain unutilized and DSAC that are available for collateral purposes however not regularly utilized in practice. 6 Assets that cannot be used to support funding or collateral requirements in their current form. This category includes those a ssets that are potentially eligible as funding program collateral or for pledging to central banks (for example, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation insured mortgages that can be securitized into NHA MBS). 7 Includes trading loans, securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL and other financial assets designated at FVTPL, fina ncial assets at FVOCI, and DSAC. 8 Assets reported in the “Bank-owned assets” column represent the value of the loans extended and not the value of the collateral received. The loan value from the reverse repurchase transactions is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” col umn to avoid double-counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 9 The loan value from the margin loans/client activity is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities f inancing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double- counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 10 Other assets include investment in Schwab, goodwill, other intangibles, land, buildings, equipment, and other depreciable asse ts, deferred tax assets, amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, and other assets on the balance sheet not reported in the above categories. In addition to the Severe Combined Stress Scenario, the Bank performs liquidity stress testing on multiple alternate scenarios. These scenarios are a mix of TD- specific events and market-wide stress events designed to test the impact from risk factors material to the Bank’s risk profile. Liquidity assessments are also part of the Bank’s Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing program. The Bank has liquidity contingency funding plans (CFP) in place at the overall Bank level and for subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions (“Regional CFPs”). The Bank’s CFP provides a documented framework for managing unexpected liquidity situations and thus is an integral component of the Bank’s overall liquidity risk management program. It outlines different contingency levels based on the severity and duration of the liquidity situation and identifies recovery actions appropriate for each level. For each recovery action, it provides key operational steps required to execute the action. Regional CFPs identify recovery actions to address region-specific stress events. The actions and governance structure outlined in the Bank’s CFP are aligned with the Bank’s Crisis Management Recovery Plan. Credit ratings impact the Bank’s borrowing costs and ability to raise funds. Rating downgrades could potentially result in higher financing costs, increased requirements to pledge collateral, reduced access to capital markets, and could also affect the Bank’s ability to enter into derivative transactions. Credit ratings and outlooks provided by rating agencies reflect their views and are subject to change from time-to-time, based on a number of factors including the Bank’s financial strength, competitive position, and liquidity, as well as factors not entirely within the Bank’s control, including the methodologies used by rating agencies and conditions affecting the overall financial services industry.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second-quarter 2022 report provides a detailed analysis of its liquid assets, both encumbered and unencumbered, across various asset types and currencies. As of April 30, 2022, the bank's total liquid assets amounted to approximately CAD 860 billion, with 33% denominated in Canadian dollars and 67% in other currencies. The report highlights a decrease in total liquid assets from October 31, 2021, when they were CAD 874 billion. The bank's unencumbered liquid assets were CAD 568 billion, slightly down from CAD 580 billion in October 2021. The report also outlines the bank's liquidity risk management strategies, including stress testing and contingency funding plans, which are designed to manage unexpected liquidity situations. Additionally, the report discusses the impact of credit ratings on the bank's borrowing costs and access to capital markets, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong credit ratings to avoid increased financing costs and collateral requirements."

The Bank regularly reviews the level of increased collateral its trading counterparties would require in the event of a downgrade of TD’s credit rating. The Bank holds liquid assets to ensure it is able to provide additional collateral required by trading counterparties in the event of a three-notch downgrade in the Bank’s legacy senior debt ratings. The following table presents the additional collateral that could have been contractually required to be posted to over-the-counter (OTC) derivative counterparties as of the reporting date in the event of one, two, and three-notch downgrades of the Bank’s credit ratings. TABLE 36: ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR RATING DOWNGRADES1 (millions of Canadian dollars) Average for the three months ended April 30 2022 January 31 2022 One-notch downgrade $ 182 $ 181 Two-notch downgrade 287 287 Three-notch downgrade 1,132 1,118 1 The above collateral requirements are based on each OTC trading counterparty’s Credit Support Annex and the Bank’s credit rating across applicable rating agencies. The LCR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of the stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) over the net cash outflow requirements in the next 30 days under a hypothetical liquidity stress event. Other than during periods of financial stress, the Bank must maintain the LCR above 100% in accordance with the OSFI LAR requirement. The Bank’s LCR is calculated according to the scenario parameters in the LAR guideline, including prescribed HQLA eligibility criteria and haircuts, deposit run-off rates, and other outflow and inflow rates. HQLA held by the Bank that are eligible for the LCR calculation under the LAR are primarily central bank reserves, sovereign-issued or sovereign-guaranteed securities, and high-quality securities issued by non-financial entities.",

The ratings cover various financial instruments, including deposits, senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred shares, and short-term debt, all of which have a stable outlook. The text also discusses the potential collateral requirements in the event of a downgrade in TD's credit ratings, detailing the additional collateral that might be needed for one, two, and three-notch downgrades. Furthermore, it explains the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a Basel III metric, which TD Bank must maintain above 100% to meet regulatory requirements, ensuring sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period."

These activities include clearing, custody, or cash management services. 7 Includes uncommitted credit and liquidity facilities, stable value money market mutual funds, outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, and other contractual cash outflows. With respect to outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, TD has no contractual obligation to buy back these outstanding TD debt securities, and as a result, a 0% outflow rate is applied under the OSFI LAR guideline. 8 Total HQLA includes both asset haircuts and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (HQLA assets after haircuts are capped at 40% for Level 2 and 15% for Level 2B). 9 Total Net Cash Outflows include both inflow and outflow rates and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (in flows are capped at 75% of outflows). The Bank’s average LCR of 119% for the quarter ended April 30, 2022 continues to meet the regulatory requirements. The Bank holds a variety of liquid assets commensurate with liquidity needs of the organization. Many of these assets qualify as HQLA under the OSFI LAR guideline. The average HQLA of the Bank for the quarter ended April 30, 2022 was $323 billion (January 31, 2022 – $327 billion), with Level 1 assets representing 85% (January 31, 2022 – 84%). The Bank’s reported HQLA excludes excess HQLA from the U.S. Retail operations, as required by the OSFI LAR guideline, to reflect liquidity transfer considerations between U.S. Retail and its affiliates as a result of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s regulations. By excluding excess HQLA, the U.S. Retail LCR is effectively capped at 100% prior to total Bank consolidation. As described in the “How TD Manages Liquidity Risk” section of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report, the Bank manages its HQLA and other liquidity buffers to the higher of TD’s 90-day surplus requirement and the target buffers over regulatory requirements from the LCR, NSFR, and the Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) metrics. As a result, the total stock of HQLA is subject to ongoing rebalancing against the projected liquidity requirements. The NSFR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of total available stable funding (ASF) over total required stable funding (RSF) in accordance with OSFI’s LAR guideline. The Bank must maintain an NSFR ratio equal to or above 100% in accordance with the LAR guideline. The Bank’s ASF comprises the Bank’s liability and capital instruments (including but not limited to deposits and wholesale funding). The Bank’s RSF comprises the Bank’s assets and off-balance sheet activities and is a function of the liquidity characteristics and maturity profile of these assets.

These may include, but are not limited to, items such as capital with perpetual maturity, non-maturity deposits, short positions, open maturity positions, non-HQLA equities, and physical traded commodities. 2 Weighted values are calculated after the application of respective NSFR weights, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline. 3 As defined by the OSFI LAR guideline, stable deposits from retail and SME customers are deposits that are insured and are either held in transactional accounts or the depositors have an established relationship with the Bank that makes deposit withdrawals highly unlikely. 4 Operational deposits from non-SME business customers are deposits kept with the Bank in order to facilitate their access and ability to conduct payment and settlement activities. These activities include clearing, custody, or cash management services. 5 Interdependent asset and liability items are deemed by OSFI to be interdependent and have RSF and ASF risk factors adjusted to zero. Interdependent liabilities cannot fall due while asset is still on balance sheet, cannot be used to fund any other assets and principal payments from the asset cannot be used for anything other than repaying the liability. As such, the only interdependent assets and liabilities that qualify for this treatment at the Bank are the liabilities arising from the Canada Mortgage Bonds Program and their corresponding encumbered assets. 6 Includes Residential Mortgages and HELOCs. The Bank’s NSFR for the quarter ended April 30, 2022 is at 122% (October 31, 2021 – 125%) and has met the regulatory requirements. The NSFR changes quarter-to-quarter are based on a number of factors including deposit and loan growth, changes in capital levels, wholesale funding issuance and maturities, and changes in the maturity profile of wholesale funding.

The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was 122% as of April 30, 2022, also meeting regulatory standards. The report notes that the bank manages its liquidity to meet both regulatory requirements and internal targets, with ongoing rebalancing of HQLA against projected needs. Changes in NSFR are influenced by factors such as deposit and loan growth, capital levels, and wholesale funding activities."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS The Bank has access to a variety of unsecured and secured funding sources. The Bank’s funding activities are conducted in accordance with the liquidity management policy that requires assets be funded to the appropriate term and to a prudent diversification profile. The Bank’s primary approach to managing funding activities is to maximize the use of deposits raised through personal and commercial banking channels. The following table illustrates the Bank’s large base of personal and commercial, wealth, and Schwab sweep deposits (collectively, “P&C deposits”) that make up over 75% of the Bank’s total funding. TABLE 39: SUMMARY OF DEPOSIT FUNDING (millions of Canadian dollars) As at Page 40 April 30 2022 October 31 2021 P&C deposits – Canadian Retail $ 523,126 $ 519,466 P&C deposits – U.S. Retail1 494,074 472,742 Total $ 1,017,200 $ 992,208 1 P&C deposits in U.S. Retail are presented on a CAD equivalent basis and therefore period-over-period movements reflect both underlying growth and changes in the foreign exchange rate. The Bank maintains various registered external wholesale term (greater than 1 year) funding programs to provide access to diversified funding sources, including asset securitization, covered bonds, and unsecured wholesale debt. The Bank r aises term funding t hrough Senior Notes, NHA MBS, and notes backed by credit card receivables (Evergreen Credit Card Trust) and home equity lines of credit (Genesis Trust II). The Bank’s wholesale funding is diversified by geography, by currency, and by funding types. The Bank raises short-term (1 year and less) funding using certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and bankers’ acceptances. The following table summarizes the registered term funding and capital programs by geography, with the related program size as at April 30, 2022. Canada United States Europe Capital Securities Program ($15 billion) Canadian Senior Medium-Term Linked Notes Program ($4 billion) HELOC ABS Program (Genesis Trust II) ($7 billion) U.S. SEC (F-3) Registered Capital and Debt Program (US$75 billion) United Kingdom Listing Authority (UKLA) Registered Legislative Covered Bond Program ($80 billion) UKLA Registered European Medium-Term Note Program (US$20 billion) The following table presents a breakdown of the Bank’s term debt by currency and funding type. Term funding as at April 30, 2022, was $120.5 billion (October 31, 2021 – $100.7 billion). Note that Table 40: Long-Term Funding and Table 41: Wholesale Funding do not include any funding accessed via repurchase transactions or securities financing. TABLE 40: LONG-TERM FUNDING As at Long-term funding by currency April 30 2022 October 31 2021 Canadian dollar 33 % 37 % U.S. dollar 41 38 Euro 19 18 British pound 5 4 Other 2 3 Total 100 % 100 % Long-term funding by type Senior unsecured medium-term notes 63 % 59 % Covered bonds 23 24 Mortgage securitization1 13 15 Term asset-backed securities 1 2 Total 100 % 100 % 1 Mortgage securitization includes mortgage-backed securities issued to external investors and excludes the residential mortgage trading business. The Bank maintains depositor concentration limits in respect of short-term wholesale deposits so that it is not overly reliant on individual depositors for funding. The Bank further limits short-term wholesale funding maturity concentration in an effort to mitigate refinancing risk during a stress event. TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS The following table represents the remaining maturity of various sources of funding outstanding as at April 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021.

Excludes $1.6 billion of stru ctured notes subject to conversion under the “bail-in” regime (October 31, 2021 – $1.4 billion). 6 Subordinated notes and debentures are not considered wholesale funding as they may be raised primarily for capital management purposes. 7 Includes fixed-term deposits from non-bank institutions (unsecured) of $17.3 billion (October 31, 2021 – $14.6 billion) and the remaining are non-term deposits. Excluding the Wholesale Banking residential mortgage trading business, the Bank’s total mortgage-backed securities issued to external investors for the three and six months ended April 30, 2022 was $0.5 billion and $0.9 billion (three and six months ended April 30, 2021 – $0.4 billion and $1.0 billion) and other asset-backed securities issued for the three and six months ended April 30, 2022 was nil (three and six months ended April 30, 2021 – nil). The Bank also issued $14.6 billion and $22.3 billion of unsecured medium-term notes for the three and six months ended April 30, 2022 (three and six months ended April 30, 2021 – $4.5 billion and $9.9 billion) and $7.6 billion of covered bonds for the three and six months ended April 30, 2022 (three and six months ended April 30, 2021 – nil). In January 2022, OSFI published finalized updates to its LAR guideline, following a public consultation period that began in March 2021. The primary changes to the LAR involve enhancements to the NCCF supervisory tool to improve the risk sensitivity to the metric. Significant changes include the addition of contingencies for undrawn loan commitments, changes to certain loan cash inflows, and the adjustment of deposit runoff factors. The effective date of the changes will be April 2023. In January 2022, OSFI published an updated Pillar 3 Disclosure Guideline, which covers liquidity disclosures among other topics. The guideline provides OSFI’s updated expectations for the domestic implementation of Basel’s Pillar 3 Framework. The guideline will not materially impact the Bank’s existing liquidity disclosures, but will contribute to improved consistency and comparability of disclosures across jurisdictions. The effective date of the changes will be in the second quarter of 2023. MATURITY ANALYSIS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet categories by remaining contractual maturity. Off-balance sheet commitments include contractual obligations to make future payments on certain lease-related commitments, certain purchase obligations, and other liabilities. The values of credit instruments reported in the following table represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the Bank could be obligated to extend should such instruments be fully drawn or utilized. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contractual amounts is not representative of expected future liquidity requirements. These contractual obligations have an impact on the Bank’s short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The maturity analysis presented does not depict the degree of the Bank’s maturity transformation or the Bank’s exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk. The Bank ensures that assets are appropriately funded to protect against borrowing cost volatility and potential reductions to funding market availability. The Bank utilizes stable non-maturity deposits (chequing and savings accounts) and term deposits as the primary source of long-term funding for the Bank’s non-trading assets including personal and business term loans and the stable balance of revolving lines of credit. Additionally, the Bank issues long-term funding in respect of such non-trading assets and raises short term funding primarily to finance trading assets. The liquidity of trading assets under stressed market conditions is considered when determining the appropriate term of the funding.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's Second Quarter 2022 report highlights its diversified funding strategy, emphasizing a strong reliance on personal and commercial deposits, which constitute over 75% of its total funding. The bank also utilizes various wholesale funding sources, including asset securitization, covered bonds, and unsecured debt, diversified by geography and currency. As of April 30, 2022, the bank's term funding increased to $120.5 billion from $100.7 billion in October 2021, with a significant portion in U.S. dollars. The bank maintains depositor concentration limits to mitigate refinancing risks and ensures assets are appropriately funded to manage liquidity and interest rate risks. Additionally, the report notes updates to regulatory guidelines affecting liquidity and disclosure, effective in 2023, which aim to enhance risk sensitivity and consistency across jurisdictions."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS SECURITIZATION AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Bank enters into securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations. The Bank is involved with structured entities (SEs) that it sponsors, as well as entities sponsored by third parties. Refer to “Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section, Note 9: Transfers of Financial Assets and Note 10: Structured Entities of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report and “Transfers of Financial Assets Qualifying for Derecognition” section of Note 6 of the Bank’s second quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended April 30, 2022. Securitization of Bank-Originated Assets The Bank securitizes residential mortgages, personal loans, credit cards and business and government loans to enhance its liquidity position, to diversify sources of funding, and to optimize the management of the balance sheet. Residential Mortgage Loans The Bank securitizes residential mortgage loans through significant consolidated and unconsolidated SEs and Canadian non-SE third parties. Residential mortgage loans securitized by the Bank may give rise to full derecognition of the financial assets depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In instances where the Bank fully derecognizes residential mortgage loans, the Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through retained interests. Consumer Instalment and Other Personal Loans The Bank securitizes consumer instalment and other personal loans through a consolidated SE. The Bank consolidates the SE as it serves as a financing vehicle for the Bank’s assets, the Bank has power over the key economic decisions of the SE, and the Bank is exposed to the majority of the residual risks of the SE. Credit Card Loans The Bank securitizes credit card loans through an SE. The Bank consolidates the SE as it serves as a financing vehicle for the Bank’s assets, the Bank has power over the key economic decisions of the SE, and the Bank is exposed to the majority of the residual risks of the SE. Business and Government Loans The Bank securitizes business and government loans through significant unconsolidated SEs and Canadian non-SE third parties. Business and government loans securitized by the Bank may be derecognized from the Bank’s balance sheet depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In instances where the Bank fully derecognizes business and government loans, the Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through retained interests. There are no ECLs on the retained interests of the securitized business and government loans as the mortgages are all government insured. Securitization of Third Party-Originated Assets Significant Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities The Bank securitizes third party-originated assets through Bank-sponsored SEs, including its Canadian multi-seller conduits which are not consolidated. These Canadian multi-seller conduits securitize Canadian originated third-party assets. The Bank administers these multi-seller conduits and provides liquidity facilities as well as securities distribution services; it may also provide credit enhancements. TD’s maximum potential exposure to loss due to its ownership interest in commercial paper and through the provision of liquidity facilities for multi-seller conduits was $10.2 billion as at April 30, 2022 (October 31, 2021 – $10.5 billion). In addition, as at April 30, 2022, the Bank had committed to provide $4.0 billion in liquidity facilities that can be used to support future asset-backed commercial paper in the purchase of deal-specific assets (October 31, 2021 – $2.1 billion). Off-Balance Sheet Exposure to Third Party-Sponsored Conduits The Bank has off-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits arising from providing liquidity facilities and funding commitments of $3.0 billion as at April 30, 2022 (October 31, 2021 – $2.5 billion). The assets within these conduits are comprised of individual notes backed by automotive loan receivables, credit card receivables, equipment receivables and trade receivables. On-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits have been included in the financial statements. The Bank’s unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. For details of the Bank’s accounting policies under IFRS, refer to Note 2 of the Bank’s second quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. For details of the Bank’s significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions under IFRS, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s second quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no new accounting policies that have been adopted by the Bank for the three and six months ended April 30, 2022. ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The ECL model requires the application of estimates and judgment in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. Page 44",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second quarter 2022 report highlights its securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements, which are part of its regular operations. The bank engages in securitizing various assets, including residential mortgages, personal loans, credit card loans, and business and government loans, to enhance liquidity, diversify funding sources, and optimize balance sheet management. The report notes no significant changes in these arrangements as of April 30, 2022. The bank also securitizes third-party originated assets through unconsolidated special purpose entities and has off-balance sheet exposure to third-party sponsored conduits. The maximum potential exposure to loss from these activities was $10.2 billion, with additional liquidity commitments of $4.0 billion. The bank's financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, with no new accounting policies adopted in the reported period. The report emphasizes the importance of accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions, particularly in the context of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model, which requires significant judgment due to economic uncertainties."

The Bank continues to progress on its transition plan for the overnight, one-month, three- month, six-month and twelve-month US LIBOR settings which will cease to be published immediately after June 30, 2023. On May 16, 2022, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Ltd. (RBSL), the administrator of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), announced that the calculation and publication of all tenors of CDOR will permanently cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. The announcement follows the completion of RBSL’s public consultation regarding the potential cessation of CDOR. The Bank has incorporated this development into its benchmark rate reform plan to ensure an orderly transition and to manage the impact through appropriate mitigating actions. These actions include incorporating appropriate fallback language in contracts, making available new products referencing the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) or other alternative reference rates (ARRs), ceasing the issuance of CDOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy CDOR-based contracts, and preparing for overall operational readiness. The following standard has been issued, but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of applying the standard on the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and will adopt the standard when it becomes effective. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the Bank. OSFI’s related advisory precludes early adoption. The standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The Bank is proceeding with the implementation efforts accordingly. During the most recent interim period, there have been no changes in the Bank’s policies and procedures and other processes that comprise its internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Financial and Banking Terms Adjusted Results: Non-GAAP financial measures used to assess each of the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts reported results for “items of note”. The items of note relate to items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance. Allowance for Credit Losses: Represent expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. Allowance for credit losses consists of Stage 3 allowance for impaired financial assets and Stage 2 and Stage 1 allowance for performing financial assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals, and impacted by foreign exchange. Amortized Cost: The amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization, using EIRM, of any differences between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. Assets under Administration (AUA): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers where the Bank provides services of an administrative nature, such as the collection of investment income and the placing of trades on behalf of the clients (where the client has made his or her own investment selection). The majority of these assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets under Management (AUM): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers, managed by the Bank, where the Bank has discretion to make investment selections on behalf of the client (in accordance with an investment policy). In addition to the TD family of mutual funds, the Bank manages assets on behalf of individuals, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments and foundations. These assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Some assets under management that are also administered by the Bank are included in assets under administration. Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP): A form of commercial paper that is collateralized by other financial assets. Institutional investors usually purchase such instruments in order to diversify their assets and generate short-term gains. Asset-Backed Securities (ABS): A security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or “backed”) by a specified pool of underlying assets. Average Common Equity: Average common equity for the business segments reflects the average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Average Interest-Earning Assets: A non-GAAP financial measure that depicts the Bank’s financial position, and is calculated as the average carrying value of deposits with banks, loans and securities based on daily balances for the period ending October 31 in each fiscal year. Basic Earnings per Share (EPS): A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted basic EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Basis Points (bps): A unit equal to 1/100 of 1%. Thus, a 1% change is equal to 100 basis points. Book Value per Share: A measure calculated by dividing common shareholders’ equity by number o f common shares at the end of the period. Carrying Value: The value at which an asset or liability is carried at on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO): They are collateralized debt obligations consisting of mortgage-backed securities that are separated and issued as different classes of mortgage pass-through securities with different terms, interest rates, and risks. CMOs by private issuers are collectively referred to as non-agency CMOs. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: This is a primary Basel III capital measure comprised mainly of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. Regulatory deductions made to arrive at the CET1 Capital include goodwill and intangibles, unconsolidated investments in banking, financial, and insurance entities, deferred tax assets, defined benefit pension fund assets, and shortfalls in allowances. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio: CET1 Capital ratio represents the predominant measure of capital adequacy under Basel III and equals CET1 Capital divided by RWA. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): A measure of growth over multiple time periods from the initial investment value to the ending investment value assuming that the investment has been compounding over the time period. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA): CVA represents a capital charge that measures credit risk due to default of derivative counterparties. This charge requires banks to capitalize for the potential changes in counterparty credit spread for the derivative portfolios. Diluted EPS: A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusting for the effect of all potentially dilutive common shares. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Payout Ratio: A ratio represents the percentage of Bank’s earnings being paid to common shareholders in the form of dividends and is calculated by dividing common dividends by net income available to common shareholders. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Yield: A ratio calculated as the dividend per common share for the year divided by the daily average closing stock price during the year. Effective Income Tax Rate: A rate and performance indicator calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes as a percentage of net income before taxes. Adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated in the same manner using adjusted results. Effective Interest Rate (EIR): The rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The calculation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts. Effective Interest Rate Method (EIRM): A technique for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument’s book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Under EIRM, the effective interest rate, which is a key component of the calculation, discounts the expected future cash inflows and outflows expected over the life of a financial instrument. Page 46 TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Efficiency Ratio: The efficiency ratio measures operating efficiency and is calculated by taking the non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue. A lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted non-interest expenses and total revenue. Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF): Established by the Financial Stability Board in May 2012, comprised of banks, analysts, investors, and auditors, with the goal of enhancing the risk disclosures of banks and other financial institutions. Expected Credit Losses (ECLs): ECLs are the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions that impact the Bank’s credit risk assessment. Fair Value: The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Under IFRS 9, if the asset passes the contractual cash flows test (named SPPI), the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classified. If the instrument is being held to collect contractual cash flows, that is, if it is not expected to be sold, it is measured as amortized cost. If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is measured at FVOCI. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Under IFRS 9, the classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI) and a business model assessment. Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in profit or loss. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): A U.S. government corporation which provides deposit insurance guaranteeing the safety of a depositor’s accounts in member banks. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in receiverships (failed banks). Forward Contracts: Over-the-counter contracts between two parties that oblige one party to the contract to buy and the other party to sell an asset for a fixed price at a future date. Futures: Exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Hedging: A risk management technique intended to mitigate the Bank’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other market factors. The elimination or reduction of such exposure is accomplished by engaging in capital markets activities to establish offsetting positions. Impaired Loans: Loans where, in management’s opinion, there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent that the Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. Loss Given Default (LGD): It is the amount of the loss the Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a loan, which is expressed as a percentage of exposure at default. Mark-to-Market (MTM): A valuation that reflects current market rates as at the balance sheet date for financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Master Netting Agreements: Legal agreements between two parties that have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default or termination of any one contract. Net Corporate Expenses: Non-interest expenses related to corporate service and control groups which are not allocated to a business segment. Net Interest Margin: A non-GAAP ratio calculated as net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to measure performance. This metric is an indicator of the profitability of the Bank’s earning assets less the cost of funding. Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC): Instruments (preferred shares and subordinated debt) that contain a feature or a provision that allows the financial institution to either permanently convert these instruments into common shares or fully write-down the instrument, in the event that the institution is no longer viable. Notional: A reference amount on which payments for derivative financial instruments are based. Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI): The regulator of Canadian federally chartered financial institutions and federally administered pension plans. Options: Contracts in which the writer of the option grants the buyer the future right, but not the obligation, to buy or to sell a security, exchange rate, interest rate, or other financial instrument or commodity at a predetermined price at or by a specified future date. Price-Earnings Ratio: A ratio calculated by dividing the closing share price by EPS based on a trailing four quarters to indicate market performance. Adjusted price-earnings ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted EPS. Probability of Default (PD): It is the likelihood that a borrower will not be able to meet its scheduled repayments. Provision for Credit Losses (PCL): Amount added to the allowance for credit losses to bring it to a level that management considers adequate to reflect expected credit-related losses on its portfolio. Return on Common Equity (ROE): The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity, utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. Adjusted ROE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Return on Risk-weighted Assets: Net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average risk-weighted assets. Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a percentage of average Tangible common equity. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Both measures can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA): Assets calculated by applying a regulatory risk-weight factor to on and off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight factors are established by the OSFI to convert on and off-balance sheet exposures to a comparable risk level. Page 47 TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Securitization: The process by which financial assets, mainly loans, are transferred to structures, which normally issue a series of asset-backed securities to investors to fund the purchase of loans. Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI): IFRS 9 requires that the following criteria be met in order for a financial instrument to be classified at amortized cost:  The entity’s business model relates to managing financial assets (such as bank trading activity), and, as such, an asset is held with the intention of collecting its contractual cash flows; and  An asset’s contractual cash flows r epresent SPPI. Swaps: Contracts that involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payment obligations and currencies on a notional principal for a specified period of time. Tangible common equity (TCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as common shareholders’ equity less goodwill, imputed goodwill, and intangibles on an investment in Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other acquired intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. It can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Taxable Equivalent Basis (TEB): A calculation method (not defined in GAAP) that increases revenues and the provision for income taxes on certain tax- exempt securities to an equivalent before-tax basis to facilitate comparison of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Tier 1 Capital Ratio: Tier 1 Capital represents the more permanent forms of capital, consisting primarily of common shareholders’ equity, retained earnings, preferred shares and innovative instruments. Tier 1 Capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 Capital divided by RWA. Total Capital Ratio: Total Capital is defined as the total of net Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital. Total Capital ratio is calculated as Total Capital divided by RWA. Total Shareholder Return (TSR): The change in market price plus dividends paid during the year as a percentage of the prior year’s closing market price per common share. Trading-Related Revenue: A non-GAAP financial measure that is the total of trading income (loss), net interest income on trading positions, and income from financial instruments designated at FVTPL that are managed within a trading portfolio. Trading-related revenue (TEB) in the Wholesale Banking segment, which is part of the total Bank’s trading-related revenue, is also a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in the same manner, including TEB adjustments. Both are used for measuring trading performance. Value-at-Risk (VaR): A metric used to monitor and control overall risk levels and to calculate the regulatory capital required for market risk in trading activities. VaR measures the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of time. Page 48",

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second-quarter 2022 financial report highlights several key insights:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet Growth**: Total assets increased to CAD 1,825 billion as of April 30, 2022, from CAD 1,729 billion on October 31, 2021. This growth was driven by increases in loans, particularly residential mortgages and business loans.\n\n2. **Income Statement**: Net income for the three months ended April 30, 2022, was CAD 3,811 million, up from CAD 3,695 million in the same period in 2021. For the six months ended April 30, 2022, net income was CAD 7,544 million, compared to CAD 6,972 million in 2021.\n\n3. **Revenue and Expenses**: Total revenue for the quarter was CAD 11,263 million, with net interest income contributing CAD 6,377 million. Non-interest expenses increased slightly to CAD 6,033 million, driven by higher salaries and employee benefits.\n\n4. **Credit Losses**: The provision for credit losses was CAD 27 million for the quarter, a reversal from a recovery of CAD 377 million in the same period last year, indicating a shift in credit conditions.\n\n5. **Comprehensive Income**: The bank reported a total comprehensive loss of CAD 380 million for the quarter, primarily due to significant losses in other comprehensive income, including changes in cash flow hedges and foreign currency translation.\n\n6. **Equity and Dividends**: Shareholders' equity remained stable at approximately CAD 99 billion. The bank declared dividends of CAD 0.89 per common share, up from CAD 0.79 in the previous year.\n\n7. **Cash Flows**: Operating activities generated CAD 17,449 million in cash for the six months ended April 30, 2022, while investing activities used CAD 12,300 million, and financing activities used CAD 5,589 million.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group showed strong financial performance with increased net income and asset growth, despite challenges in comprehensive income due to market conditions."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) NOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS The Toronto-Dominion Bank is a bank chartered under the Bank Act. The shareholders of a bank are not, as shareholders, liable for any liability, act, or default of the bank except as otherwise provided under the Bank Act. The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”). The Bank was formed through the amalgamation on February 1, 1955, of The Bank of Toronto (chartered in 1855) and The Dominion Bank (chartered in 1869). The Bank is incorporated and domiciled in Canada with its registered and principal business offices located at 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario. TD serves customers in three business segments operating in a number of locations in key financial centres around the globe: Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking. The accompanying Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting principles followed by the Bank have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including the accounting requirements of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. These Interim Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on a condensed basis in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting using the accounting policies as described in Note 2 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain comparative amounts have been revised to conform with the presentation adopted in the current period. The preparation of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements requires that management make judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as further described in Note 3 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 3 of this report. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future confirming events occur. The Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. All intercompany transactions, balances, and unrealized gains and losses on transactions are eliminated on consolidation. The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months ended April 30, 2022, were approved and authorized for issue by the Bank’s Board of Directors, in accordance with a recommendation of the Audit Committee, on May 25, 2022. As the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the disclosures normally provided in the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, they should be read in conjunction with the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes, and the shaded sections of the 2021 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). Certain disclosures are included in the shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the MD&A in this report, as permitted by IFRS, and form an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 2: CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES There were no new accounting policies that have been adopted by the Bank for the three and six months ended April 30, 2022. The following standard has been issued, but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of applying the standard on the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and will adopt the standard when it becomes effective. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the Bank. OSFI’srelated advisory precludes early adoption. The standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The Bank is proceeding with the implementation efforts accordingly. Page 54",
        "summary": "The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank Group) operates under the Bank Act and serves customers through Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking segments globally. The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the second quarter of 2022 were prepared in accordance with IFRS and approved by the Board of Directors on May 25, 2022. These statements are presented in Canadian dollars and require management to make estimates and judgments. No new accounting policies were adopted during this period. The Bank is assessing the impact of IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts, which will replace IFRS 4 and become effective for TD on November 1, 2023. This standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable."

Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The expected credit loss (ECL) model requires the application of estimates and judgment in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s approach and methodologies used to determine fair value measurements for the three and six months ended April 30, 2022. (a) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE The following table reflects the fair value of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second-quarter 2022 report highlights the importance of estimates and judgments in its accounting policies, which are crucial for understanding its financial results and condition. These policies involve complex judgments due to inherent uncertainties, and changes in these estimates or accounting standards could significantly impact the bank's financial statements. The bank has procedures to ensure consistent application of accounting policies and systematic adoption of new standards. The report also discusses the expected credit loss (ECL) model, which requires judgment in assessing economic conditions and credit risk. Temporary adjustments are applied when certain effects are not fully captured in model calculations. Additionally, there have been no significant changes in the methodologies for fair value measurements. The report provides a table showing the fair value of financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, indicating slight differences between carrying and fair values for various financial instruments as of April 30, 2022, compared to October 31, 2021."

Page 56 TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS (c) TRANSFERS BETWEEN FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY LEVELS FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS The Bank’s policy is to record transfers of assets and liabilities between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy using the fair values as at the end of each reporting period. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the three and six months ended April 30, 2022 or the three months ended April 30, 2021. During the six months ended April 30, 2021, $400 million of fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Canadian government debt were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1. There were no significant transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 during the three and six months ended April 30, 2022. During the three and six months ended April 30, 2021, transfers were made out of Level 3 and into Level 2 for trading deposits and equity contracts due to changes in the degree of observability of certain inputs in the fair value measurement of these instruments. There were no other significant changes to the unobservable inputs and sensitivities for assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 during the three and six months ended April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's Second Quarter 2022 Report to Shareholders provides detailed insights into the fair value hierarchy of its assets and liabilities as of April 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021. The report categorizes assets and liabilities into three levels based on the observability of inputs used in their valuation. Key highlights include:\n\n1. **Fair Value Hierarchy**: Most assets and liabilities are classified under Level 2, indicating they are valued using observable market data. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the reporting periods, and only minor movements between Level 2 and Level 3.\n\n2. **Level 3 Assets and Liabilities**: The report provides a reconciliation of changes in fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities, which are valued using significant unobservable inputs. There were minor changes in these assets and liabilities, with some realized and unrealized gains and losses reported.\n\n3. **Unrealized Gains and Losses**: The report details unrealized gains and losses on securities at fair value through other comprehensive income. As of April 30, 2022, there were notable unrealized losses on government and corporate debt securities compared to October 31, 2021.\n\n4. **Equity Securities**: The bank designated certain equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive income, with an increase in fair value and dividend income recognized compared to the previous period.\n\n5. **Debt Securities**: The report notes net realized gains and losses on debt securities, with a net gain reported for the six months ended April 30, 2022, compared to a net loss in the same period in 2021.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the bank's approach to managing and reporting the fair value of its financial instruments, with a focus on transparency and adherence to fair value measurement standards."

        "chunk": "(d) CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT SECURITIES The Bank evaluates non-retail credit risk on an individual borrower basis, using both a borrower risk rating (BRR) and facility risk rating, as detailed in the shaded area of the “Managing Risk” section of the 2021 MD&A. This system is used to assess all non-retail exposures, including debt securities. The following table provides the gross carrying amounts of debt securities measured at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI by internal risk ratings for credit risk management purposes, presenting separately those debt securities that are subject to Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 allowances. Refer to the “Allowance for Credit Losses” table in Note 6 for details regarding the allowance and provision for credit losses on debt securities.

The allowance for credit losses on all remaining financial assets is not significant. (e) FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Relevant macroeconomic factors are incorporated in risk parameters as appropriate. Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. The key macroeconomic variables used in determining ECLs include regional unemployment rates for all retail exposures and regional housing price indices for residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. For business and government loans, the key macroeconomic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, and credit spreads. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of how forward-looking information is generated and considered in determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and in measuring ECLs. Macroeconomic Variables Select macroeconomic variables are projected over the forecast period. The following table represents the average values of the macroeconomic variables over the four calendar quarters starting with the current quarter, and the remaining 4-year forecast period for the base forecast and upside and downside scenarios used in determining the Bank’s ECLs as at April 30, 2022. As the forecast period increases, information about the future becomes less readily available and projections are anchored on assumptions around structural relationships between economic parameters that are inherently much less certain. The economy has made substantial progress in recovering from the economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as the economic risks from the pandemic recede, rising geopolitical tensions and heightened inflationary pressures pose new uncertainties to the economic outlook.

Key insights include:\n\n1. **Allowance for Credit Losses**: The total allowance for credit losses decreased from $8,945 million in April 2021 to $7,148 million in April 2022 for the three-month period, and from $9,384 million to $7,255 million for the six-month period. This reflects a reduction in provisions across various loan categories, including residential mortgages, consumer installment loans, credit cards, and business and government loans.\n\n2. **Loan Categories**: The allowance for residential mortgages, consumer installment and other personal loans, credit cards, and business and government loans all saw changes in provisions, write-offs, and recoveries. Notably, credit card allowances saw significant write-offs, while business and government loans experienced a decrease in provisions.\n\n3. **Allowance by Stage**: The report breaks down allowances by stages of credit risk (Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3), showing movements between stages due to changes in credit risk. There were notable transfers between stages, reflecting changes in the credit quality of the bank's loan portfolio.\n\n4. **Macroeconomic Factors**: The bank incorporates macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, GDP, home prices, and interest rates into its expected credit loss (ECL) calculations. The economic outlook considers the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and inflationary pressures.\n\n5. **Forward-Looking Information**: The bank uses base, upside, and downside scenarios to project macroeconomic variables over a forecast period, which influence the ECLs. The scenarios reflect varying assumptions about economic conditions, including unemployment rates, GDP growth, and interest rates in Canada and the United States.\n\nOverall, the report highlights a decrease in the bank's allowance for credit losses, driven by improved credit conditions and adjustments in response to macroeconomic forecasts."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS (f) SENSITIVITY OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ECLs are sensitive to the inputs used in internally developed models, the macroeconomic variables in the forward-looking forecasts and respective probability weightings in determining the probability-weighted ECLs, and other factors considered when applying expert credit judgment. Changes in these inputs, assumptions, models, and judgments would affect the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of ECLs. The following table presents the base ECL scenario compared to the probability-weighted ECLs, with the latter derived from three ECL scenarios for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The difference reflects the impact of deriving multiple scenarios around the base ECLs and resultant change in ECLs due to non-linearity and sensitivity to using macroeconomic forecasts. Change from Base to Probability-Weighted ECLs (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) As at April 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 6,203 $ 6,608 Base ECLs 6,055 6,412 Difference – in amount $ 148 $ 196 Difference – in percentage 2.4 % 3.1 % ECLs for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments consist of an aggregate amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 probability-weighted ECLs which are twelve­ month ECLs and lifetime ECLs, respectively. Transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2 ECLs result from a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the loan. The following table shows the estimated impact of staging on ECLs by presenting all performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments calculated using twelve-month ECLs compared to the current aggregate probability-weighted ECLs, holding all risk profiles constant. Incremental Lifetime ECLs Impact (millions of Canadian dollars) As at April 30, 2022 October 31, 2021 Probability-weighted ECLs (millions of Canadian dollars) All performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments using 12-month ECLs $ 6,203 4,621 $ 6,608 4,903 Incremental lifetime ECLs impact $ 1,582 $ 1,705 (g) FORECLOSED ASSETS Foreclosed assets are repossessed non-financial assets where the Bank gains title, ownership, or possession of individual properties, such as real estate properties, which are managed for sale in an orderly manner with the proceeds used to reduce or repay any outstanding debt. The Bank does not generally occupy foreclosed properties for its business use. The Bank predominantly relies on third-party appraisals to determine the carrying value of foreclosed assets. Foreclosed assets held for sale were $47 million as at April 30, 2022 (October 31, 2021 – $53 million), and were recorded in Other assets on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet. (h) LOANS PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED A loan is classified as past due when a borrower has failed to make a payment by the contractual due date. The following table summarizes loans that are past due but not impaired. Loans less than 31 days contractually past due are excluded as they do not generally reflect a borrower’sability to meet their payment obligations.

(i) TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS QUALIFYING FOR DERECOGNITION Canada Emergency Business Account Program Under the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) Program, with funding provided by Her Majesty in Right of Canada (the “Governmentof Canada”) and Export Development Canada as the Government of Canada’s agent, the Bank provided eligible business banking customers with an interest-free, partially forgivable loan of up to $60,000. On January 12, 2022, it was announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 for all eligible borrowers in good standing. If the loan is not repaid by December 31, 2023, it will be extended for an additional 2-year term bearing an interest rate of 5% per annum. The application window for new CEBA loans and expansion requests closed on June 30, 2021. The funding provided to the Bank by the Government of Canada in respect of the CEBA Program represents an obligation to pass-through collections on the CEBA loans and is otherwise non-recourse to the Bank. Accordingly, the Bank is required to remit all collections of principal and interest on the CEBA loans to the Government of Canada but is not required to repay amounts that its customers fail to pay or that have been forgiven. The Bank receives an administration fee to recover the costs to administer the program for the Government of Canada. Loans issued under the program are not recognized on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as the Bank transfers substantially all risks and rewards in respect of the loans to the Government of Canada.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's Second Quarter 2022 Report to Shareholders highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Allowance for Credit Losses (ECLs):** ECLs are sensitive to various inputs, including macroeconomic forecasts and expert credit judgment. The report compares base ECLs with probability-weighted ECLs, showing a slight increase in the latter due to non-linearity and sensitivity to macroeconomic variables. As of April 30, 2022, the probability-weighted ECLs were CAD 6,203 million, a 2.4% increase from the base ECLs.\n\n2. **Foreclosed Assets:** The bank manages foreclosed assets, primarily real estate, for sale to repay outstanding debts. As of April 30, 2022, foreclosed assets held for sale were valued at CAD 47 million.\n\n3. **Loans Past Due but Not Impaired:** The report provides a summary of loans past due but not impaired, with a total of CAD 1,591 million as of April 30, 2022, across various categories such as residential mortgages, consumer instalments, credit cards, and business loans.\n\n4. **Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) Program:** Under this program, the bank provided interest-free, partially forgivable loans to eligible businesses. The repayment deadline for these loans has been extended to December 31, 2023. The bank acts as an intermediary, passing through collections to the Government of Canada, and does not recognize these loans on its balance sheet as it transfers all risks and rewards to the government."

As such, the Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The Bank’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. The Bank takes into account changes in the subsequent period that would significantly affect the results. As at April 30, 2022, the Bank’s reported investment in Schwab was 13.37% (October 31, 2021 – 13.41%) of the outstanding voting and non-voting common shares of Schwab with a fair value of $22 billion (US$17 billion) (October 31, 2021 – $26 billion (US$21 billion)) based on the closing price of US$66.33 (October 31, 2021 – US$82.03) on the New York Stock Exchange. The Bank and Schwab are party to a stockholder agreement (the “StockholderAgreement”)under which the Bank has the right to designate two members of Schwab’s Board of Directors and has representation on two Board Committees, subject to the Bank meeting certain conditions. The Bank’s designated directors currently are the Bank’s Group President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank’s Chair of the Board. Under the Stockholder Agreement, the Bank is not permitted to own more than 9.9% voting common shares of Schwab, and the Bank is subject to customary standstill restrictions and, subject to certain exceptions, transfer restrictions. In addition, the Schwab IDA Agreement has an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. The condensed financial statements of Schwab, based on its most recent published consolidated financial statements, are included in the following tables. The carrying value of the Bank’s investment in Schwab of $9.7 billion as at April 30, 2022 (October 31, 2021 – $11.1 billion) represents the Bank’sshare of Schwab’s stockholders’equity, adjusted for goodwill, other intangibles, and cumulative translation adjustment.

Thereafter, the dividend rate will reset every five years equal to the then five-year Government of Canada bond yield plus 3.317%. The Series 27 Shares are redeemable by the Bank, subject to regulatory approval, at $1,000 per share during the period from October 2, 2027 to and including October 31, 2027, and during the period from October 1 to and including October 31 every 5th year thereafter. 2 Consists of Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCNs). For LRCNs, the number of shares represents the number of notes issued. 3 When the Bank purchases its own equity instruments as part of its trading business, they are classified as treasury instruments and the cost of these instruments is recorded as a reduction in equity. On May 25, 2022, the Board approved a dividend in an amount of eighty nine cents (89 cents) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the Bank for the quarter ending July 31, 2022, payable on and after July 31, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 8, 2022. The Bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan for its common shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on common shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from the Bank’s treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’sdiscretion, or from the open market at market price. The Bank has determined that, beginning with the dividend approved on May 25, 2022 for the quarter ending July 31, 2022, and until further announcement, the Bank will issue the common shares from treasury and will apply a 2% discount to the average market price of such common shares. On January 7, 2022, the Bank announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange and OSFI had approved the Bank’s previously announced normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to repurchase for cancellation up to 50 million of its common shares. During the three months ended April 30, 2022, the Bank repurchased 13.5 million common shares under the NCIB, at an average price of $105.95 per share, for a total amount of $1.4 billion, which represents a $1.3 billion premium over the share capital amount. During the six months ended April 30, 2022, the Bank repurchased 21 million common shares under the NCIB, at an average price of $104.50 per share, for a total amount of $2.2 billion, which represents a $1.9 billion premium over the share capital amount. Concurrent with the announcement of the Bank’s acquisition of First Horizon on February 28, 2022, the Bank’s automatic share purchase plan established under its NCIB automatically terminated pursuant to its terms.",

All other assumptions are updated annually. 3 Amounts are presented on a pre-tax basis. NOTE 16: INCOME TAXES The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), Revenu Québec Agency (RQA) and Alberta Tax and Revenue Administration (ATRA) are denying certain dividend deductions claimed by the Bank. During the quarter, the ATRA reassessed the Bank for $21 million of additional income tax and interest in respect of its 2015 and 2016 taxation years. As at April 30, 2022, the CRA has reassessed the Bank for $1,186 million of income tax and interest for the years 2011 to 2016, the RQA has reassessed the Bank for $34 million for the years 2011 to 2015, and the ATRA has reassessed the Bank for $54 million for the years 2011 to 2016. In total, the Bank has been reassessed for $1,274 million of income tax and interest. The Bank expects the CRA, RQA, and ATRA to continue to reassess open years on the same basis. The Bank is of the view that its tax filing positions were appropriate and intends to challenge all reassessments. Proposed Tax Measures in the Canadian Federal Budget The Canadian Federal budget presented on April 7, 2022 (“the Budget”) proposes to introduce a tax on bank and life insurer groups, referred to as the Canada Recovery Dividend. This is expected to be in the form of a 15% tax on the 2021 taxable income above $1 billion, paid in equal instalments over five years. The Budget also proposes to introduce an additional permanent tax on bank and life insurer groups of 1.5% of taxable income above $100 million. The additional tax would apply to taxation years that end after April 7, 2022 and will be prorated for the first year. These taxes, if enacted as proposed, will result in higher amounts of taxes payable in each of the impacted years, as well as revaluation adjustments to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Bank is monitoring the status of the Budget proposals and will determine the impact to the Bank’s results when the legislation is substantively enacted. Page 75",

For the six months, these figures were $1,041 million and $82 million, respectively.\n\n3. **Income Tax Reassessments**: The bank is facing reassessments from Canadian tax authorities, totaling $1,274 million for income tax and interest for various years between 2011 and 2016. The bank plans to challenge these reassessments, maintaining that its tax positions were appropriate.\n\n4. **Proposed Tax Measures**: The Canadian Federal Budget proposes new taxes on bank and life insurer groups, including a 15% Canada Recovery Dividend on 2021 taxable income above $1 billion and an additional 1.5% tax on taxable income above $100 million. These measures, if enacted, will increase the bank's tax liabilities and affect deferred tax assets and liabilities. The bank is monitoring these proposals to assess their impact."

Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the same method as basic earnings per share except that certain adjustments are made to net income attributable to common shareholders and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares that are assumed to be issued by the Bank. The following table presents the Bank’s basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021. Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) For the three months ended For the six months ended April 30 2022 April 30 2021 April 30 2022 April 30 2021 Basic earnings per share Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,745 $ 3,630 $ 7,435 $ 6,842 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (millions) 1,804.7 1,817.4 1,812.8 1,815.7 Basic earnings per share (Canadian dollars) $ 2.08 $ 2.00 $ 4.10 $ 3.77 Diluted earnings per share Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,745 $ 3,630 $ 7,435 $ 6,842 Net income available to common shareholders including impact of dilutive securities 3,745 3,630 7,435 6,842 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (millions) 1,804.7 1,817.4 1,812.8 1,815.7 Effect of dilutive securities Stock options potentially exercisable (millions)1 3.6 2.5 3.7 2.1 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding – diluted (millions) 1,808.3 1,819.9 1,816.5 1,817.8 Diluted earnings per share (Canadian dollars)1 $ 2.07 $ 1.99 $ 4.09 $ 3.76 1 For the three and six months ended April 30, 2022 and April 30, 2021, no outstanding options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. NOTE 18: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Other than as described below, there have been no new significant events or transactions as previously identified in Note 27 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, including but not limited to civil claims and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits and requests for information by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions. The Bank establishes provisions when it becomes probable that the Bank will incur a loss and the amount can be reliably estimated. The Bank also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) in its legal and regulatory actions (that is, those which are neither probable nor remote), in excess of provisions. As at April 30, 2022, the Bank’s RPL is from zero to approximately $1.41 billion (October 31, 2021 – from zero to approximately $1.45 billion). The Bank’s provisions and RPL represent the Bank’s best estimates based upon currently available information for actions for which estimates can be made, but there are a number of factors that could cause the Bank’s provisions and/or RPL to be significantly different from its actual or RPL. For example, the Bank’s estimates involve significant judgment due to the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants in many proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, some of which are beyond the Bank’s control and/or involve novel legal theories and interpretations, the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. In addition, some actions seek very large or indeterminate damages. In management’sopinion, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the ultimate disposition of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or the consolidated cash flows of the Bank. However, because of the factors listed above, as well as other uncertainties inherent in litigation and regulatory matters, there is a possibility that the ultimate resolution of legal or regulatory actions may be material to the Bank’s consolidated results of operations for any particular reporting period. Stanford Litigation – On January 20, 2022, in the US Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al action Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Bank’smotion for summary judgment. Also on January 20, 2022, the Rotstain Court issued a Suggestion of Remand that recommended to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”)that the Rotstain matter be remanded for further proceedings to the Southern District of Texas. That day, the JPML issued a Conditional Remand Order, which took effect on January 27, 2022. On March 10, 2022, the Rotstain matter was transferred to the Southern District of Texas. On April 29, 2022, the bank defendants, including the Bank, moved to dismiss certain of plaintiffs’claims for lack of jurisdiction and lack of standing. A joint status report was filed in the Smith v. Independent Bank et al. action on January 31, 2022. In the report, the removing bank defendant requested a status conference to address how to resolve the overlapping issues with the Rotstain litigation. Plaintiffs’ position is that the Smith matter should continue to be stayed. In Ontario, the hearing of the appeal in the Joint Liquidators’action took place on April 20-21, 2022. The Court of Appeal for Ontario has taken the matter under reserve and will issue a written decision in due course. Credit Card Fees – On December 10, 2021, after a joint settlement approval hearing on December 6, 2021, the national settlement was approved by the five courts in which the actions were filed.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's second-quarter 2022 report highlights the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the periods ending April 30, 2022, and April 30, 2021. Basic EPS is derived from net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares. Diluted EPS accounts for potential shares from stock options. For the three months ended April 30, 2022, basic EPS was CAD 2.08, and diluted EPS was CAD 2.07, both showing an increase from the previous year.\n\nThe report also discusses contingent liabilities, noting that the bank is involved in various legal and regulatory actions. As of April 30, 2022, the range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) is estimated between zero and CAD 1.41 billion. Despite these legal proceedings, management believes they will not materially affect the bank's financial condition or cash flows, though they could impact results in specific reporting periods.\n\nSpecific legal cases mentioned include the Stanford Litigation and Credit Card Fees settlement, with ongoing proceedings and settlements in various jurisdictions."

NOTE 21: REGULATORY CAPITAL The Bank manages its capital under guidelines established by OSFI. The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to credit, market, and operational risks. The Bank has various capital policies, procedures, and controls which it utilizes to achieve its goals and objectives. On November 22, 2019, the Bank was designated a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). During the six months ended April 30, 2022, the Bank complied with the OSFI Basel III guidelines related to capital ratios and the leverage ratios. Effective January 1, 2016, OSFI’starget Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios for Canadian banks designated as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) includes a 1% common equity capital surcharge bringing the targets to 8%, 9.5%, and 11.5%, respectively. On June 25, 2018, OSFI provided greater transparency related to previously undisclosed Pillar 2 CET1 capital buffers through the introduction of the public domestic stability buffer (DSB) which is held by D-SIBs against Pillar 2 risks. The current buffer is set at 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets (RWA) and must be met with CET1 Capital, effectively raising the OSFI CET1 minimum target to 10.5%. The OSFI target includes the greater of the D-SIB or G-SIB surcharge, both of which are currently 1%. On September 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI’sTotal Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guideline. Under this guideline, the Bank was required to meet supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.0% of RWA, inclusive of the 2.50% DSB, and TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75% by November 1, 2021. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio. The following table summarizes the Bank’s regulatory capital positions as at April 30, 2022 and October 31, 2021.
