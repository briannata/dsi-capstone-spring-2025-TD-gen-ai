Reported ea rnings were $3.4 billion, down 12% compared with the second quarter last year, and adjusted earnings were $3.8 billion, up 1%. “TD’s retail businesses in both Canada and the United States continued to show strong revenue and earnings growth this quarter, with robust customer originations and loan volumes,” said Bharat Masrani, Group President and CEO, TD Bank Group. “Invest ments in differentiated wealth and insurance products and the close of the Cowen acquisition expanded our offerings and strengthened the competitive advantages of these businesses.” Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking delivered double digit revenue growth Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking net income was $1,625 million, an increase of 4% compared with the second quarter last year. Revenue was $4,404 million, an increase of 11% reflecting higher margins and volume growth. The segment delivered a seventh consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking continued to deliver growth in the quarter supported by increased customer activity which included record second quarter New to Canada account openings, continued momentum in mortgage originations, and strong credit card loan growth. TD recently launched an exclusive Canadian bank offer with Uber, adding to TD’s list of leading partnerships, including Air Canada, Amazon, Expedia, and Starbucks. TD was also recognized in the 2023 Canada’s Best Awards by MoneySense, receiving the most awards of any fi nancial institution, including in the best no-fee, flat rate, and travel credit cards ca tegories. The U.S. Retail Bank delivered another strong quarter despite a challenging environment U.S. Retail reported net income of $1,412 million, an increase of 3% (US$1,044 million, a decrease of 3% in U .S. dollars) compared with the second quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, net income was $1,528 million, an increase of 28% (US$1,129 million, an increase of 19% in U.S. dollars). Reported net income included acquisition and integration-related charges for the First Horizon Corporation (“First Horizon”) acquisition of $154 million or US$113 million ($116 million or US$85 million after-tax). The Bank’s investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) contributed $250 million in earnings, an increase of 12% (US$185 million, an increase of 5% in U.S. dollars) compared with the second quarter last year.

        "page_content": "- ANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 2 TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank® (TD AMCB), launched two innovative new proprietary credit cards, TD Flex Pay and TD C lear. It also continued to execute on its retail network expansion and wealth strategy by opening five stores, part of a broader plan to accelerate the execution of its organic growth strategies by opening new stores in South Florida, Atlanta and the Carolinas. TD AMCB was again recognized as one of Am erica’s Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes in 2023. As announced on May 4, 2023, the Bank and Fi rst Horizon entered into a mutual agreement to terminate the previously announced merger, and all acquisition related activities are being wound down. Wealth Management and Insurance delivered solid performance amid challenging market conditions Wealth Management and Insurance net income was $563 million, a decrease of 16% compared with the second quarter of last year reflecting lower earnings in the wealth management business. This quarter’s revenue growth of 2% underscored the strength of the segment’s diversified business model as higher insurance revenue and net interest income largely offset the impact of trading normalization and market volatility. This quarter, Wealth Management and Insurance continued to focus on customer-centric innovation with the launch of Small Business Insurance, delivering a differentiated insurance experience for small business owners from Canada’s #1 direct insurer. TD Direct Investing continued to maintain its #1 position across all categories, including Gross New Accounts, Revenue, Trades and Assets Under Administration, with share of new accounts and trades both increasing year-over-year.1 1 Investor Economics Retail Brokerage and Distribution Quarterly Update, Winter 2023 Wholesale Banking closed its acquisition of Cowen Inc. Wholesale Banking reported net income for the quarter was $150 million, a decrease of $209 million, or 58%, compared with the second quarter last year. This reflects higher non-interest expenses, which include acquisition and integration costs, partially offset by higher revenues. On an adjusted basis, net income was $213 million, a decrease of $146 million, or 41%. Revenue was up 13%, reflecting the benefit of TD Cowen as well as growth in transaction banking and lending, partially offset by lower trading-related revenue reflecting a weaker market environment. This quarter, TD Securities was recognized as Lead Manager of the Year, Social Bonds – Sovereign by Environmental Finance’s 2023 Bond Awards, demonstrating its continued leadership in Environmental, Social, and Governance. The Wholesale Bank continued to invest in i ts long-term U.S. growth strategy and further extended its global reach and capabilities with the closing of the Cowen Inc. acquisition on March 1, welcoming 1,700 new colleagues to TD Securities. Capital TD’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio was 15.3%. Conclusion For fiscal 2023, in light of the mutual termination of the First Horizon merger agreement, and the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the Bank does not expect to meet its medium-term adjusted EPS growth target range of 7-10%. “As we enter the second half of 2023, TD’s businesses are strong, and our customer and client relationships continue to expand. We are successfully operating in an unpredictable operating environment, supported by robust capital and liquidity and the best bankers in the industry,” added Masrani. “I would like to thank our colleagues for their tremendous efforts, and for delivering the legendary experiences that are the hallmark of TD.” The foregoing cont ains forward-looking statements.

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Bank’s unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in this Report to Shareholders and with the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes and 2022 MD&A. This MD&A is dated May 24, 2023. U nless otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars and have been primarily derived from the Bank’s 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes or Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and rel ated Notes, prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Note that certain comparative amounts have been revised to conform with the presentation adopted in the current period. Additional information relating to the Bank, including the Bank’s 2022 Annual Information Form, is available on the Bank’s website at http://www.td.com, as well as on SEDAR at http://www.sedar.com and on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov (EDGAR filers section). Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements From time to time, the Bank (as defined in this document) makes written and/or oral forward-looking statements, including in this document, in other filings with Canadian regulators or the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in other communications. In addition, representatives of the Bank may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. All such statements are made pursuant to the “safe harbour” provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“2022 MD&A”) in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report under the heading “Economic Summary and Outlook”, under the headings “Key Priorities for 2023” and “Operating Environment and Outlook” for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading “2022 Accomplishments and Focus for 2023” for the Corporate segment, and in other statements regarding the Bank’s objectives and priorities for 2023 and beyond and strategies to achieve them, the regulatory environment in which the Bank operates, and the Bank’s anticipated financial performance. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “will”, “would”, “should”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”, “plan”, “goal”, “target”, “may”, and “could”. By their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond the Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, and infrastructure), model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors include general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates; geopolitical risk; inflation, rising rates and recession; the economic, financial, and other impacts of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; the ability of the Bank to execute on long-term strategies and shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion and integration of acquisitions and dispositions, business retention plans, and strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks, data security breaches or technology failures) on the Bank’s information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; model risk; fraud activity; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the Bank’s use of third-party service providers; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations, including without limitation tax laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; exposure related to significant litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes to the Bank’s credit ratings; changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition risk; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Bank; existing and potential international debt crises; environmental and social risk (including climate change); and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events. The Bank cautions that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Bank’s results. For more detailed information, please refer to the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2022 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as applicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the heading “Significant Acquisitions”, “Significant and Subsequent Events, and Pending Acquisitions” or “Significant and Subsequent Events” in the relevant MD&A, which applicable releases may be found on www.td.com . All such factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, should be considered carefully when making decisions with respect to the Bank. The Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on the Bank’s forward-looking statements. Material economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this document are set out in the 2022 MD&A under the heading “Economic Summary and Outlook”, under the headings “Key Priorities for 2023” and “Operating Environment and Outlook” for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading “2022 Accomplishments and Focus for 2023” for the Corporate segment, each as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders. Any forward-looking statements contained in this document represent the views of management only as of the date hereof and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank’s shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank’s financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. The Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on its behalf, except as required under applicable securities legislation.

Under the terms of the termination agreement, the Bank made a US$225 million cash payment to First Horizon on May 5, 2023. The termination payment will be reported within the Corporate segment financial results for the third quarter ending July 31, 2023. In connection with the transaction, the Bank had invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock. During the current quarter, the Bank recognized a valuation adjustment loss of $199 million on this investment based on First Horizon’s common share price at the end of the quarter, recorded in Other Comprehensive Income. In accordance with the preferred shares purchase agreement and the terms of the preferred stock, subject to certain conditions, the preferred stock will convert into approximately 19.7 million common shares of First Horizon in the third quarter. Prior to the announcement on May 4, 2023 to t erminate the merger agreement, the Bank had implemented a strategy to mitigate the impact of interest rate volatility to capit al on closing of the acquisition. The Bank determined that the fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets would have been sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net asset s would have determined the amount of goodwill to be recogni zed on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles would have negatively impacted capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to m itigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships. As a result of the de- designat ion, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps were recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) would have mitigated the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the ac quisition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments. For the three months and six months ended April 30, 2023, the Bank reported ($263) million and ($1,261) million, respectively, in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $129 million and $251 million, respectively, in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, fo r the three months and six months ended April 30, 2023, the Bank reported $311 million and $562 million, respectively, in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps. Following the announcement on May 4, 2023 to ter minate the merger agreement, the Bank discontinued this strategy and reinstated hedge accounting on the portfolio of fixed income investments. The Bank had also implemented a strategy to mitigate FX risk on the expected USD cash consideration. Following the announcement on May 4, 2023 to terminate the merger agreement, the Bank discontinued this strategy. Given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar during the life of the strategy, the Bank was in a net gain position on the date of hedge termination and cumulative net gains were recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Implementation of the Canada Recovery Dividend and Change in Corporate Tax Rate On December 15, 2022, Bill C-32, Fall Economic Statement Implementation Act, 2022, received Royal Assent. This bill enacted the Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD) and increased the Canadian federal tax rate for bank and life insurer groups by 1.5%. The implementation of the CRD resulted in a provision for income taxes of $553 million and a charge to other comprehensive income of $239 million, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the Canadian federal tax rate of 1.5%, prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, resulted in a provision for income taxes of $82 million and a tax benefit of $75 million in other comprehensive income related to fiscal 2022, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank also remeasured certain Canadian deferred tax assets and liabilities for the increase in tax rate, which resulted in an increase in net deferred tax assets of $50 million, which is recorded in provision for income taxes. Stanford Litigation Settlement In the US Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. action, on February 24, 2023, the Bank reached a settlement in principle (the “settlement” or “agreement”) relating to l itigation involving the Stanford Financial Group (the “Stanford litigation”). Once the settlement is approved by the Court, the Bank will pay US$1.205 billion to the court-appointed receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate. Under the terms of the agreement, TD has settled with the receiver, the Official Stanford Investors Committee, and other plaintiffs in the litigation and these parties have agreed to release and dismiss all current or future claims arising from or related to the Stanford matter. As a result of this agreement, the Bank recorded a provision of approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax ($1.2 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank recognized a foreign exchange loss of $39 million ($28 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting the impact of the difference between the foreign exchange rate used for recording the provision (effective January 31, 2023) and the foreign exchange rate at the time the set tlement was reached."

        "page_content": "- TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 7 The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”). TD is the sixth largest bank in North America by assets and serves more than 27.5 million customers in four key businesses operating in a number of locations in financial centres around the globe: Canadian Pe rsonal and Commercial Banking, including TD Canada Trust and TD Auto Finance Canada; U.S. Retail, including TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank®, Auto Finance U.S., TD Wealth (U.S.), and an investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation; Wealth Management and Insurance, including TD Wealth (Canada), TD Direct Investing, and TD Insurance; and Wholesale Banking. TD also ranks among the world’s leading online financial services firms, with more than 16 million active online and mobile customers. TD had $1.9 trillion in assets on April 30, 2023. The Toronto-Dominion Bank trades under the symbol “TD” on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges. The Bank prepares its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS and refers to results prepared in accordance with IFRS as “reported” results. Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures In addition to reported results, the Bank also presents certain financial measures, including non-GAAP f inancial measures that are historical, non-GAAP ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures, to assess its results. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as “adjusted” results, are utilized to assess the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note” from reported results. Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP ratios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings per sh are (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the Bank’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, t herefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. Supplementary financial measures depict the Bank’s financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the Bank’s capital position, and bo th are explained in this document where they first appear. U.S. Strategic Cards The Bank’s U.S. strategic cards portfolio is comprised of agreements with certain U.S. retailers pursuant to which TD is the U.S. issuer of private label and co branded consumer credit cards to their U.S. customers. Under the terms of the individual agreements, the Bank and the retailers share in the profits generated by the relevant portfolios after credit losses. Under IFRS, TD is required to present the gross amount of revenue and provisions for credit losses (PCL) related to th ese portfolios in the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Statement of Income. At the segment level, the retailer program partners’ share of r evenues and credit losses is p resented in t he Corporate segment, with an offsetting amount (representing the partners’ net share) recorded in Non-interest expenses, resulting in no impact to Corporate’s reported Net income (loss). The Net income (loss) included in the U.S. Retail segment includes only the portion of r evenue and credit losses attributable to TD under the agreements. Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation On October 6, 2020, the Bank acquired an approximately 13.5% stake in The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) following the completion of Schwab’s a cquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (“TD Ameritrade”) of which the Bank was a major shareholder (the “Schwab transaction”). On August 1, 2022, the Bank sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Schwab, which reduced the Bank’s ownership interest in Schwab to approximately 12.0%. The Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The U.S. Retail segment reflects the Bank’s share of net i ncome from its investment in Schwab. The Corporate segment net income (loss) includes amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Sc hwab transaction. The Bank’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. For further details, refer to Note 7 of the Bank’s second quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. On November 25, 2019, the Bank and Schwab signed an insured deposit account agreement (“2019 Schwab IDA Agreement”), with an initial expiration date of Jul y 1, 2031. Pursuant to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank made sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Starting July 1, 2021, Schwab had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Sch wab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. Refer to the “Related Party Transactions” section in the 2022 MD&A for further details. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into an amended insured deposit account agreement (the “2023 Schwab IDA Agreement”), which replaced the 20 19 Schwab IDA Agreement. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by t hree years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its f irst six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until September 2025, the aggregate amount of fixed rate obligations will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to US$5 bi llion of fixed rate obligations by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to certain limits."

Adjusted ROE is a non-GAAP financial ratio and can be uti lized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Capital allocated to the business segments was increased to 11% CET1 Capital effective the first quarter of 2023, compared with 10.5% in fiscal 2022.

Reported and adjusted results and items of note are explained in “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in the “How We Performed” section of this document. • Adjusted diluted EPS for the six months ended April 30, 2023, increased 2% from the same period last year. • Adjusted ROTCE for the six months ended April 30, 2023, was 19.8%. • For the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, the total shareholder return was -7.5% compared to the Canadian peer 2 average of -6 .3%. 2 Canadian peers in clude Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Comm erce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Bank of Nova Scotia. Net Income Quarterly comparison – Q2 2023 vs. Q2 2022 Reported net income for the quarter was $3,351 million, a decrease of $460 million, or 12%, compared with the second quarter last year primarily reflecting acqu isition and integration-related charges, an insurance recovery related to litigation in the prior year, and a net loss from mitigation of impact from interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition. On an adjusted basis, net income for the quarter was $3,752 million, an increase of $38 million, or 1%, compared with the second quarter last year reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses, higher PCL and insurance claims and related expenses. By segment, the decrease in reported net income reflects decreases in the Corporate segment of $248 million, in Wholesale Banking of $209 million, and in Wealth Management and Insurance of $105 million, partially offset by increases in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $57 million and in U.S. Retail of $45 million. Quarterly comparison – Q2 2023 vs. Q1 2023 Reported net income for the quarter increased $1,769 million, compared with the prior quarter primarily reflecting the Stanford litigation settlement, and the recognition of a provision for income taxes in connection with the CRD and increase in the Canadian federal tax rate for fiscal 2022 in the prior quarter, and a lower net loss from mitigation of impact from interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition. Adjusted net income for the quarter decreased $4 03 million, or 10%, reflecting lower revenues and higher non-interest expenses, partially offset by lower insurance claims and related expenses and PCL. By se gme nt, the increase in r eported net income reflects increases in the Corporate segment of $2,218 million, and in Wealth Management and Insurance of $13 million, partially offset by decreases in Wholesale Banking of $181 million, in U.S. Retail of $177 million, and in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $104 million. Year-to-date comparison – Q2 2023 vs. Q2 2022 Reported net income of $4,933 million decreased $2,611 million, or 35%, compared with the same period last year. The decrease reflects the Stanford litigation settlement, a net loss from mitigation of impact from interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition, recognition of a provision for income taxes in connection with the CRD and increase in the Canadian federal tax rate for fiscal 2022, acquisition and integration-related charges in the current period, and an insurance recovery related to litigation in the prior period. Adjusted net income was $7,907 million, an increase of $360 million, or 5%, compared with the same period last year reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses, PCL and insurance claims and related expenses. By segment, the decrease in r eported net income reflects decreases in the Corporate segment of $2,638 million, in Wholesale Banking of $312 million, and in Wealth Management and Insurance of $191 million, partially offset by increases in U.S. Retail of $362 million, and in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $168 million."

Year-to-date comparison – Q2 2023 vs. Q2 2022 Insurance claims and related expenses were $1,780 million, an increase of $432 million, or 32%, compared with the same period last year, reflecting the impact of chan ges in the discount rate which resulted in a similar increase in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income, and increased driving activity and inflationary costs. Non-Interest Expenses and Efficiency Ratio Quarterly comparison – Q2 2023 vs. Q2 2022 Reported non-interest expenses were $6,987 million, an increase of $954 million, or 16%, compared with the second quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher emplo yee-related expenses, acquisition and integration-related charges, the impact of foreign exchange translation, and higher spend supporting business growth. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses were $6,693 million, an increase of $694 million, or 12%. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects increases in U.S. Retail of $418 million, in Wholesale Banking of $413 million, and in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $144 million, partially offset by decreases in the Corporate segment of $14 million and in Wealth Management and Insurance of $7 million.

Income Taxes The Bank’s effective income tax rate on a reported basis was 21.8% for the current quarter, compared with 21.7% in the second quarter last year and 42.2% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the increase in the Canadian income tax rate and the impact of business mix while the quarter-over quarter decrease primarily reflects tax adjustments associated with the implementation of the CRD and the tax rate increase for 2022 booked in the prior quarter. To allow for an after-tax calculation of adjusted income, the adjusted provision for income taxes is calculated by adjusting the taxes for each item of note using the statutory income tax rate of the applicable legal entity. The adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes before other taxes as a percentage of adjusted net income before taxes. The Bank’s adjusted effective income tax rate was 21.9% for the current quarter, compared with 21.6% in the second quarter last year and 21.8% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the increase in the Canadian income tax rate and the impact of business mix. The quarter-over-quarter increase primarily reflects business mix.

Budgetary Tax Measures The Canadian Federal budget presented on M arch 28, 2023 (“the Budget”) proposes to introduce tax measures that could impact the Bank. The Budget proposes to deny financial institutions a deduction in respect of dividends received on shares of other corporations resident in Canada and introduces a 2% tax on the net value of share repurchases by public corporations in Canada. The Budget also announced an amendment to the definition of a “financial service” such that payment card clearing services rendered by a payment card network operator will be subject to GST/HST. In addition to these specific measures, the Canadian government has indicated its continued support for the two-pillar plan for international tax reform initiated by the Organisation for Economic Co- operat ion and Development and announced its intention to introduce legislation implementing Pillar Two in Canada, which establishes rules for the application of the 15% global minimum tax. The impact of the Pillar Two rules will take effect for fiscal years that begin on or after December 31, 2023, which will be November 1, 2024 for the Bank. The Bank is monitoring the status of the Budget proposals and will determine the impact to the Bank’s results when the legislation is substantively enacted."

        "page_content": "- NK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 15 The global economy is f orecast to slow in calendar 2023, but to a lesser degree than previously expected. A dramatic pull-back in energy prices has provided some economic relief in Europe and the sudden end of zero-COVID policies in China has provided an earlier lift to its economic prospects. While concerns about the global economy have eased, the risk of recession remains elevated. In North America, central banks have raised policy rates dramatically over the past year. The impact of this sizeable increase is expected to be the primary influence dampening economic growth in 2023 and into 2024. The recent U.S. bank failures have tightened credit conditions, which are likely to exert an increasing drag on economic activity in the months ahead although the full effects remain uncertain. The U.S. economy expanded by 1. 1% annualized in the first calendar quarter of 2023. Underlying domestic demand accelerated to 3.2%, due to a sharp rebound in consumer spending on motor vehicles and parts, but a sharp drawdown in inventories weighed on headline economic growth. A cooler economy was e vident in softness in business investment, which expanded by only 0.7% and a continued downturn in housing activity which weighed on growth. As of April, the job market was still tight with the unemployment rate at 3.4%, the lowest in over 50 years. However, there are signs that demand for workers is cooli ng, hiring trends are slowing, job openings have declined and claims for jobless benefits have been trending higher. Inflation has started to dissipate, but unde rl ying services price pressures have been more persistent, and well above the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 2% target. TD Economics expects domestic spending to slow significantly over the second half of 2023, leading unemployment to rise gradually, and an eventual cooling in services inflation. The Federal Reserve has signalled that after having raised interest rates by 500 basis points (bps) this tightening cycle, it is now in w ait and see mode. TD Economics expects the federal funds rate will remain at its current range of 5.00-5.25% through the end of calendar 2023, before the Federal Reserve embarks on a series of interest rate cuts next year. If a further cooling in the labour market does not materialize, further interest rate increases in the coming months may be required. Given the steep rise in interest rates over the past year, the trend towards tighter U.S. credit conditions and the likelihood of rolling periods of financial stress related to the debt ceiling negotiations and/or other risk factors, the probability of a recession stateside remains elevated. Th e Canadian economy is likely to have recorded a solid rate of expansion in the first calendar quarter of 2023, reflecting a rebound from the soft fourth calendar quarter of 2022. Despite the financial impact of rising interest costs on highly indebted households, consumer spending has remained resilient amid strong job market conditions, excess savings and increased government supports. Housing has turned in a mixed performance, as homebuilding activity has slowed while resale activity has shown signs of stabilization in recent months. Canadian inflation has moderated, although the labour market remains quite strong with the unemployment rate at 5.0% in April 2023, near a cyclical low. TD Economics expects the aggregate spending of households and businesses to stagnate in the coming quarters, leading to weaker job market conditions and higher unemployment. Given the tepid growth backdrop and uncertainty surrounding the impact of past interest rate hikes on highly indebted Canadian households, the risk of recession also remains elevated in Canada. The Bank of Canada left the overnight interest rate unchanged in April, at 4.50%. It signalled an intention to leave interest rates at their current level, provided the economy and inflation continue to slow in line with its outlook. The Canadian dollar is expected to hover around the 70-75 U.S. cent range in calendar 2023. For management reporting purposes, the Bank’s business operations and activities are organized around the following four key business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The Bank ’s other activities are grouped into the Corporate segment. Results of each business segm ent reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the Bank measures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments, the Bank indicates that the measure is adju sted. For further details, refer to the “How We Performed” section of this document, the “Business Focus” section in the Bank’s 2022 MD&A, and Note 29 of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2022. PCL related to performing (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and impaired (Stage 3) financial assets, loan commitments, and financial guarantees is recorded within the respective segment. Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt income, including certain dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent pre-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking results is reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the quarter was $40 million, compared with $57 million in the prior quarter and $34 million in the second quarter last year. Share of net income from investment in Schwab is reported in the U.S. Retail segment. Amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction are recorded in the Corporate segment.

For t he U.S. Retail segment, this calculation excludes the impact related to sweep deposits arrangements and intercompany deposits and cash collateral. The value of tax-exempt interest income is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. For investment securities, the adjustment to fair value is included in the calculation of av erage interest-earning assets. Management believes this calculation better reflects segment performance. Net interest income and average interest -earning assets used in the calculation are non-GAAP financial measures. 7 For additional information ab out this metric, refer to the Glossary of this document."

Net interest income decreased $23 million, or 8%, reflecting lower volumes and margins in the wealth management business. AUA increa sed $8 billion, or 1%, and AUM increased $8 billion, or 2%, compared with the prior quarter, both primarily reflecting net asset growth. Insurance claims and related expenses for the quarter decreased $172 million, or 18%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of changes in the discount rate which resulted in a similar decrease in fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income, more favourable prior years’ claims development and lower current year claims, partially offset by more severe weather-related events. Non-interest expenses decreased $16 million, or 1%, compared with the prior quarter. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 42.6%, compared with 40.7% in the prior quarter. Year-to-date comparison – Q2 2023 vs. Q2 2022 Wealth Management and Insurance net income for the six months ended April 30, 2023, was $1,113 million, a decrease of $191 million, or 15%, compared with same period last year, reflecting lower earnings in the wealth management business, partially offset by higher earnings in the insurance business. The annualized ROE for the period was 41.9%, compared with 51.6%, in the same period last year. Revenue for the period was $5,637 million, an increase of $168 million, or 3%, compared with same period last year. Net interest income increased $115 million, or 27%, reflecting higher margins, partially offset by lower volumes in the wealth management business. Non-interest income increased $53 million, or 1%, reflecting an increase in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar increase in insurance claims, partially offset by lower fee-based and transaction revenue in the wealth management business. Insurance claims and related expenses were $1,780 million, an increase of $432 million, or 32%, compared with the same period last year, reflecting the impact of ch anges in the discount rate which resulted in a similar increase in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income, and increased driving activity and inflationary costs. Non-interest expenses were $2,348 million, a decrease of $5 million, compared with the same period last year, reflecting lower variable compensation, partially offset by higher spend supporting business growth including employee-related expenses and technology costs. The efficiency ratio for the period was 41.7%, compared with 43.0% for the same period last year.

Qua rterly comparison – Q2 20 23 vs. Q2 2022 Corporate segment’s reported net loss for the quarter was $399 million, compared with a reported net loss of $151 million in the second quarter last year. The increase primarily reflects lower revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities, a net loss from mitigation of impact from interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition and higher net corporate expenses. The adjusted net loss for the quarter was $177 million, compared with an adjusted net loss of $79 million in the second quarter last year. Quarterly comparison – Q2 20 23 vs. Q1 2023 Corporate segment’s reported net loss for the quarter was $399 million, compared with a reported net loss of $2,617 million in the prior quarter.

The impact of foreign exchange translation from the appreciation in the Canadian dollar decreased total assets by $6 billion. The increase in total assets reflects securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements of $38 billion, loans, net of allowances for loan losses of $19 billion, trading loans, securities, and other of $14 billion, other assets of $12 billion, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) of $4 billion and Investment in Schwab of $1 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $36 billion, derivative assets of $29 billion, debt securities at amortized cost (DSAC), net of allowance for credit losses of $12 bi llion and non-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) of $2 billion.

        "page_content": "TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 25 The increase in total liabilities reflects financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss of $38 billion, obligations related to securi ties sold under repurchase agreements of $19 billion, other liabilities of $14 billion and trading deposits of $1 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in deposits of $41 billion and derivatives of $27 billion. Trading deposits in creased $1 bi llion primarily reflecting new issuances. Derivative liabilities decreased $27 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss increased $38 billion primarily reflecting new issuances, partially offset by maturities. Deposits decreased $41 billion reflecting lower volumes in personal, and business and government deposits, and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by increase in bank deposits. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $19 billion reflecting an increase in volume. Other liabilities increased $14 billion primarily reflecting increase in liabilities related to structured entities, obligations related to securities sold short, dividends accrued and increase in provision for the Stanford litigation settlement. Equity was $116 billion as at April 30, 2023, an increase of $5 billion from October 31, 2022. The increase reflects gains in accumulated other comprehensive income, retained earnings and common shares issued with a 2% discount under the dividend reinvestment plan. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income is primarily driven by the impact of foreign currency translation and the Bank’s share of the other comprehensive gain from investment in Schwab. Quarterly comparison – Q2 2023 vs. Q2 2022 Gross impaired loans excluding acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans were $2,659 million as at April 30, 2023, an i ncrease of $262 million, or 11%, compared with the second quarter last year. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking gross impaired loans increased $245 million, or 27%, compared with the second quarter last year, reflecting formations outpacing resolutions in the consumer and commercial lending portfolios. U.S. Retail gross impaired loans decreased $24 million, or 2%, compared with the second quarter last year, as reductions in the real estate secured lending and commercial lending portfolios were partially offse t by some normalization in the credit card and indirect auto portfolios. Wholesale gross impaired loans increased $39 million, compared with the second quarter last year, reflecting a few new formations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net impaired loans were $1,803 million as at April 30, 2023, an increase of $108 million, or 6%, compared with the second quarter last year. The allowance for credit losses of $7,647 million as at April 30, 2023 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $862 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,766 million and Stage 1 allowance of $3,016 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $3 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $155 million, or 22%, reflecting some normalization of credit performance and the impact of foreign exchange. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses increased $579 million, or 9%, reflecting increases across segments, largely related to the impact of foreign exch ange, volume growth, and some normalization of credit performance. The allowance change included an increase of $181 million attributable to the retailer program partners’ share of the U.S. strategic cards portfolio. The allowance for debt securities decreased by $4 million, compared with the second quarter last year. Forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables deemed to be predictive of expected credit losses (ECLs) based on the Bank’s experience, is used to determine ECL scenarios and associated probability weights to determine the probability-weighted ECLs. Each quarter, all base forecast macroeconomic variables are refreshed, resulting in new upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios. The probability weightings assigned to each ECL sc enario are also reviewed each quarter and updated as required, as part of the Bank’ s ECL governance process. As a result of periodic reviews and quarterly updates, the allowance for credit losses may be revised to reflect updates in loss estimates based on the Bank’s recent loss experience and its forward-looking views. The Bank periodically reviews the methodology and has performed certain additional quantitative and qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s second quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on forward-looking information. The probability-weighted allowance for credit losses reflects the Bank’s forward-looking views. To the extent that certain anticipated effects cannot be fully incorporated into quantitative models, management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in determining the amount of ECLs. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and the allowance for credit losses will be updated in future quarters as additional information becomes available. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s second quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Bank calculates allowances for ECLs on debt securities measured at amortized cost and FVOCI. The Bank has $398 billion in such debt securities, all of which are performing (Stage 1 and 2) and none are impaired (Stage 3). The allowance for credit losses on DSAC and debt securities at FVOCI was $2 million and $1 million, respectively. Quarterly comparison – Q2 2023 vs. Q1 2023 Gross impaired loans excluding ACI loans increased $68 million, or 3%, compared with the prior quarter. Impaired loans net of allowance increased $39 million, or 2%, compared with the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses of $7,647 million as at April 30, 2023 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $862 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,766 million and Stage 1 allowance of $3,016 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $3 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $30 million, or 4%, compared with the prior quarter, related to some further normalization of credit perf ormance, largely reflected in the consumer lending portfolios. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses increased $137 million, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of foreign exchange, current credit conditions, and volume growth. The allowance for debt securities inc r eased by $1 million, compared to the prior quarter. For further details on loans, impaired loans, allowance for credit losses, and on the Bank’s use of forward-looking information and macroeconomic variables in dete rmining its allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 6 of the Bank’s second quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements."

Real Estate Secured Lending Retail real estate secured lending includes mortgages and lines of credit to North American consumers to satisfy financing needs including home purchases and refinancing. While the Bank retains first lien on the majority of properties held as security, there is a small portion of loans with second liens, but most of these are behind a TD mortgage that is in first position. In Canada, credit policies are designed so that the combined exposure of all uninsured facilities on one property does not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination. Lending at a higher loan-to-value ratio is permitted by legislation but requires default insurance. This insurance is contractual coverage for the life of eligible facilities and protects the Bank’s real estate secured lending portfolio against potential losses caused by borrowers’ default. The Bank may also purchase default insurance on lower loan-to-value ratio loans. The insurance is provided by either government-backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers. In the U.S., for residential mortgage originations, mortgage insurance is usually obtained from either government backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers when the loan-to-value exceeds 80% of the collateral value at origination. The Bank regularly performs stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio as part of its overall stress testing program. This is done with a view to determine the extent to which the portfolio would be vulnerable to a severe downturn in economic conditions. The effect of severe changes in house prices, interest rates, and unemployment levels are among the factors considered when assessing the impact on credit losses and the Bank’s overall profitability. A variety of portfolio seg ments, including dwelling type and geographical regions, are examined during the exercise to determine whether specific vulnerabilities exist.

The following table provides a summary of the period over which the Bank’s residential mortgages would be fully repaid based on the amount of the most recent payment received. All figures are calculated based on current customer payment amounts, including voluntary payments larger than the original contractual amounts and/or other voluntary prepayments. The most recent customer payment amount may exceed the original contractual amount due. Balances with a remaining amortization longer than 30 years primarily reflect Canadian variable rate mortgages where interest rate increases relative to current customer payment levels have resulted in a longer current amortization period. At renewal, the amortization period for Canadian mortgages reverts to the remaining contractual amortization, which may require increased payments.

Capital requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are commonly referred to as Basel III. Under Basel III, Total Capital consists of three components, namely CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III introduced a non-risk sensitive levera ge ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage e xpos ure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. TD manages its regulatory capital in accordance with the Basel III Capital Framework as discussed in the “Capital Position” section of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III OSFI’s Capital Adequacy Requirements guideline details how the Basel III capital rules apply to Canadian banks. Other requirements, in addition to those described in “OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III” section of Bank’s 2022 Annual Report, are noted below. The Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) level increased to 3% as of February 1, 2023. The 50 bps increase from the previous level of 2.5% ref lects OSFI’s asses sment that systemic vulnerabilities remain elevated. In addition, OSFI has increased the DSB range from 0 to 4% , instead of the previous 0 to 2.5% to allow the DSB to remain responsive to an uncertain environment. On February 1, 2023, OSFI implemented revised capital rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. These revised rules include revisions to the calculation of credit risk and operational risk requirements, and revisions to the Leverage Requirements Guideline to i nclude a requirement for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the regulatory minimum requirement of 3.0%. This buffer will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio supervisory target of 6.75%. The table below summarizes OSFI’s current regulatory minimum capital and TLAC ratios for the Bank as at April 30, 2023. Minimum Capital Conser vation Buffer -SIB / G-SIB Su rcharge1 Pillar 1 Regulatory Target2 DSB illar 1 & 2 Regulatory Target CET1 4.5 % 2.5 % 1.0 % 8.0 % 3.0 % 11.0 % Tier 1 6.0 2.5 1.0 9.5 3 .0 12.5 Tota l Capital 8.0 2.5 1.0 1 1.5 3.0 14 .5 Lev erage 3.0 n/a 0.5 3.5 n/a 3.5 TLAC 18. 0 2.5 1.0 21.5 3.0 24 .5 C Leverage 6.75 n/a 0.50 7.25 n/a 7 .25 1 The higher of the D-SIB and Glob al Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) surcharge applies to risk weighted capital. The D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the Bank’s 1% G-SIB additional common e quity requirement for risk weighted capital . The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresh olds to a maximum of 4.5%. OSFI ’s Leverage Requirements Guideline includes a requirem ent for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer set at 50% of a D-SIB’s higher loss absorbency risk-weighted requirements, effectively 0.5 0%. This buffer also applies to the TLAC Leverage ratio. 2 The Bank’s countercyclical buffer requirement is 0% as of April 30, 2023."

As at April 30, 2023, the Bank’s CET1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 15.3%, 17.3%, and 19.7%, respectively. The decrease in the Bank’s CET1 Capital ratio compar ed to October 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to RWA growth across various segments, including an increase in RWA as a result of the Cowen acquisition and an increase in the goodwill and intangibles deduction related to the Cowen acquisition. CET1 was also impacted by the Stanford litigation settle ment, the CRD, mark-to- m arket losses on swaps de-designated from hedge accounting relationships to mitigate the impacts of interest rate volatility to closing capital of the Fi rst Horizon acquisition, foreign exchange hedging of the First Horizon purchase price, and the elimination of the scaling factor related to OSFI’s transition arrangements for ECL provisioning. The impact of the foregoing items was partially offset by organic growth, and the issuance of common shares pursuant to the Bank’s dividend reinvestment plan."

The decrease in the Bank’s Leverage ratio from 4.9% as at October 31, 2022 was attributable primarily to increased leverage exposures across various segments, and an increase in the goodwill and intangibles deduction related to the Cowen acquisition, offset by organic capital growth. Future Regulatory Capital Developments Future regulatory capital developments, in addition to those described in the “Future Regulatory Capital Developments” section of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report, are noted below. On Jan uary 31, 2022, OSFI announced revised capital, leverage, liquidity and disclosure rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. The revised rules related to market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk are effective November 1, 2023.

As previously announced on March 31, 2023, the dividend rate for the Series 18 Shares for the 5-year period from and including April 30, 2023 to but excluding April 30, 2028 will be 5.747%. 3 For Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCNs), the number of shares/units represents the number of notes issued. 4 For LRCNs – Series 3, the amount represents the Canadian dollar equivalent of the U.S. dollar notional amount. Refer to the “Preferred Shares and Other Equity Instruments – Significant Terms and Conditions” table in Note 21 of the Bank’s 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. On May 24, 2023, the Board approved a dividend in an amount of ninety-six cents (96 cents) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the Bank for the quarter ending July 31, 2023, payable on and after July 31, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 10, 2023. The Bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan for its common shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on common shares are used to pur chase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion or purchased from the open market at market price. During the three months ended April 30, 2023, the Bank issued 8.9 million common shares from treasury with a 2% discount. During the three months ended April 30, 2022, the Bank issued 1.3 million common shares from treasury with no discount. On May 25, 2023, the Bank announced that beginning with the dividend approved on May 24, 2023 for the quarter ending July 31, 2023, there will no longer be a discount to the average market price applied to the issue of common shares from treasury. Most recently, the common shares have been issued from treasury at a discount of 2% to the average market price. On May 24, 2023, the Board approved the initiation of a normal course issuer bid for up to 30 million of the Bank’s common shares, subject to the approval of OSFI and t he Toronto Stock Exchange. The timing and amount of any purchases under the program are subject to regulatory approvals and management discretion based on factors such as market conditions and capital adequacy."

Growing profitability in financial results based on balanced revenue, expense and capital growth services involves selectively taking and managing risks within the Bank’ s risk appetite. The Bank’s goal is to earn a stable and sustainable rate of return for every dollar of risk it takes, while putting significant emphasis on investing in its businesses to meet its future strategic objectives. The Bank’s businesses and operations are exposed to a broad number of risks that have been identified and defined in the Enterprise Risk Framework. The Bank’ s tolerance to those risks is defined in the Enterprise Risk Appetite which has been developed within a comprehensive framework that takes into consideration current conditions in which the Bank operates and the impact that emerging risks will have on TD’s strategy and risk profile. The Bank’s risk appetite states that it takes risks required to build its business, but only if those risks: (1) fit the business strategy and can be understood and managed; (2) do not expose the enterprise to any significant single loss events; TD does not ‘bet the bank’ on any single acquisition, business, or product; and (3) do not risk harming the TD brand. Each business is responsible for setting and aligning its individual risk appetites with that of the enterprise based on a thorough examination of t he specific risks to which it is exposed. The Bank considers it cr itical to regularly assess its operating environment and highlight top and emerging risks. These are risks with a potential to have a material effect on the Bank and where the attention of senior leaders is focused due to the potential magnitude or immediacy of their impact. Risks are identified, discussed, and actioned by senior leaders and reported quarterly to the Risk Committee. Specific plans to mitigate top and emerging risks are prepared, monitored, and adjusted as required. The Bank’s risk governance structure and risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2022 Annual R eport. Additional information on risk factors can be found in this document and the 2022 MD&A under the heading “Risk Factors and Management”. For a complete discussion of t he risk governance structure and the risk management approach, refer to the “Managing Risk” section in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. The shaded sections of this MD&A represent a discussion relating to market and liquidity risks and form an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended April 30, 2023. Gross credit risk exposure, also referred to as exposure at default (EAD), is the total amount the Bank is exposed to at the time of default of a loan and is measured before counterparty-specific provisions or write-offs. Gross credit risk exposure does not reflect the effects of credit risk mitigation (CRM) and includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. On-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of outstanding loans, acceptances, non-trading securities, derivati ves, and certain other repo-style transactions. Off-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of undrawn commitments, guarantees, and certain other repo-style transactions. Gross credit risk exposures for the two approaches the Bank uses to measure credit risk are included in the following table. 27: GROSS CREDIT RISK EXPOSURE – Standardized and Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approaches1 1 Gross credit risk exposures represent EAD and are before the effects of CRM.

The Bank continuously improves its VaR methodologies and incorporates new risk measures in line with market conventions, industry best practices, and regulatory requirements. To mitigate some of the shortcomings of VaR, the Bank uses additional metrics designed for risk management and capital purposes. These include Stressed VaR, IRC, Stress Testing, as well as limits based on the sensitivity to various market risk factors. Calculating Stressed VaR In addition to VaR, the Bank also calculates Stressed VaR, which includes Stressed GMR and Stressed IDSR. Stressed VaR is designed to measure the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of stressed market conditions. Stressed VaR is determined using similar techniques and assumptions in GMR and IDSR VaR. However, instead of using the most recent 259 trading days (one year), the Bank uses a periodically reviewed and selected year of stressed market conditions. In the second quarter of 2023, Stressed VaR was calculated using the one-year period that includes the 2008 financial crisis. Stressed VaR is a part of regulatory capital requirements. Calculating the Incremental Risk Charge The IRC is applied to all instruments in the trading book subject to migration and default risk. Migration risk represents the risk of changes in the credit ratings of the Bank’s exposures. TD applies a Monte Carlo simulation with a one-year horizon and a 99.9% confidence level to determine IRC, which is consistent with regulatory requirements. IRC is based on a “constant level of risk” assumption, which requires banks to assi gn a liquidity horizon to positions that are subject to IRC. IRC is a part of regulatory capital requirements. TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Calculating VaR The Bank computes total VaR on a daily basis by combining the General Market Risk (GMR) and Idiosyncratic Debt Specific Risk (IDSR) associated with the Bank’s trading positions. GMR is determined by creating a distribution of potential changes in the market value of the current portfolio using historical simulation. The Bank values the current portfolio using the market price and rate changes of the most recent 259 trading days for equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity products. GMR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. A one-day holding period is used for GMR calculation, which is scaled up to ten days for regulatory capital calculation purposes. IDSR measures idiosyncratic (single-name) credit spread risk for credit exposures in the trading portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. The IDSR model is based on the historical behaviour of five-year idiosyncratic credit spreads. Similar to GMR, IDSR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. IDSR is measured for a ten-day holding period. The following graph discloses daily one-day VaR usage and trading net revenue, reported on a TEB, within Wholesale Banking. Trading net revenue includes trading income and net interest income related to positions within the Bank’s market risk capital trading books. For the quarter ended April 30, 2023, there were 4 days of trading losses and trading net revenue was positive for 94% of the trading days, reflecting normal trading activity. Losses in the quarter did not exceed VaR on any trading day."

It is not meaningful to co mpute a diversification effect because the high and low may occur on different days for different risk types. Av erage VaR decreased quarter-over-quarter, however increased year-over-year due to interest rate increases and credit spread widening in 2022, reflected in the historical VaR window. Average Stressed VaR decreased compared to both last quarter and same quarter last year due to changes in interest rate risk. Average IRC decreased year-over-year due to changes in bond posi tions. Validation of VaR Model he Bank uses a back-testing process to compare the actual and theoretical profit and losses to VaR to ensure that they are consistent with the statistical results of the VaR model. The theoretical profit or loss is generated using the daily price movements on the assumption that there is no change in the composition of the portfolio. Validation of the IRC model must follow a different approach since the one-year horizon and 99.9% confidence level preclude standard back-testing techniques. Instead, key parameters of the IRC model such as transition and correlation matrices are subject to independent validation by benchmarking against external study results or through analysis using internal or external data. Structural (Non-Trading) Interest Rate Risk The Ban k’s structural interest rate risk arises from traditional personal and commercial banking activity and is generally the result of mismatches between the maturities and repricing dates of the Bank’s asse ts and liabilities. The measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book does not include exposures from TD’s Wholesale Banking or Insurance businesses. The primary measures for this risk are Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS). The EVE Sensitivity measures the impact of a specified interest rate shock to the change in the net present value of the Bank’s banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items. It reflects a measurement of the potential present value impact on shareholders’ equity without an assumed term profile for the management of the Bank’s own equity and excludes product margins. The NIIS measures the NII change over a twelve-month horizon for a specified change in interest rates for banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off bala nce sheet items assuming a constant balance sheet over the period. The Bank’s Market Risk policy sets overall limits on the structural interest rate risk measures. These limits are periodically reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee. In addition to the Board policy limits, book-level risk limits are set for the Bank’s management of non-trading interest rate risk by Risk Management. Expo sures against these limits are routinely monitored and reported, and breaches of the Board limits, if any, are escalated to both the Asset/Liability and Capital Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee. The following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rates on the EVE and NIIS measures. Interest rate floors are applied by currency to the decrease in rates such that they do not exceed expected lower bounds, with the most material currencies set to a floor of -25 bps.

Since these swaps were pre-existing hedges which economically hedge the Bank’s non-trading market risk, their inclusion had no impact on the quarter-over -quarter results. This strategy was discontin ued following the announcement on May 4, 2023 by the bank and First Horizon that they had entered into a mutual agreement to terminate the previously announced merger agreement. As at April 30, 2023, an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase in interest rates would have had a negative impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,682 million, an increase of $72 million from last quarter, and a positive impact to the Bank’s NII of $785 million, a decrease of $350 million from last quarter. An immediate and sustain ed 100 bps decrease in interest rates would have had a positive impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,106 million, an increase of $50 million from last quarter, and a negative impact to the Bank’s NII of $910 million, a decrease of $306 million from last quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in up shock EVE is primarily due to a small increase in the duration of assets supported by equity. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in NII Sensitivity is primarily due to deposit attrition and changes in deposit composition. TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

Financial obligations can arise from deposit withdrawals, debt maturities, commitments to provide credit or liquidity support, or the need to pledge additional collateral. TD’S LIQUIDITY RISK APPETITE The Bank maintains a prudent and disciplined approach to managing its potential exposure to liquidity risk. The Bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under a combined bank-specific and market-wide stress scenario, and a minimum buffer over regulatory requirements prescribed by OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) guidelines. Under the LAR guidelines, Canadian banks are required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at the minimum of 100% other than during periods of financial stress and to maintain a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at the minimum of 100%. The Bank ’s funding program emphasizes maximizing deposits as a core source of funding and having ready access to wholesale funding markets across diversified terms, funding types, and currencies that is designed to ensure low exposure to a sudden contraction of wholesale funding capacity and to minimize structural liquidity gaps. The Bank also maintains a contingency funding plan to enhance preparedness for recovery from potential liquidity stress events. The Bank’s strategies and actions comprise an integrated liquidity risk management program that is designed to ensure low exposure to liquidity risk and compliance with regulatory requirements. The Bank’s ALCO oversees the Bank’s liquidity risk management program. It ensures there are effective management structures and practices in place to properly measure and manage liquidity risk. The Global Liquidity & Funding Committee, a subcommittee of the ALCO comprised of senior management from Treasury, Risk Management and Wholesale Banking, identifies and monitors the Bank’s liquidity risks. The management of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the SET member responsible for Treasury, while oversight and challenge is provided by the ALCO and i ndependently by Risk Management. The Risk Committee regularly reviews the Bank’s l iquidity position and approves the Bank’s Liquidity Risk Management Framework bi-annually and the related policies annually. The Bank has established TD Group US Holding LLC (TDGUS) as TD’s U.S. Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), as well as a Combined U.S. Operations (CUSO) reporting unit that consists of the IHC and TD’s U.S. branch and agency network. Both TDGUS and CUSO are managed to th e U.S. Enhanced Prudential Standards liquidity requirements in addition to the Bank’s liquidity management framework. The Bank’s liquidity risk appetite and liquidity risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. For a complete discussion of liquidity risk, refer to the “Liquidity Risk” section in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. Liquid assets Th e unencumbered liquid assets the Bank holds to meet its liquidity requirements must be high-quality securities that the Bank believes can be monetized quickly in stress conditions with minimum loss in market value. The liquidity value of unencumbered liquid assets considers estimated market or trading depths, settlement timing, and/or other identified impediments to potential sale or pledging. Overall, the Bank expects any reduction in market value of its liquid asset portfolio to be modest given its underlying high credit quality and demonstrated liquidity. Assets held by the Bank to m eet liquidity requirements are summarized in the following tables. The tables do not include assets held within the Bank’s insurance businesses as these are used to support insurance-specific liabilities and capital requirements.

Where a particular asset has been encumbered and TD has holdings of the asset both on-balance sheet and off balance sheet, for the purpose of this disclosure, the on- and off -balance sheet hol dings are encumbered in alignment with the business practice. 2 Assets received as c ollateral through off-balance sheet transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, margin loans, and other client activity. 3 Represents assets that have been posted externally to support the Bank’ s day-to-day operations, including securities financing transactions, clearing and payments, and derivative transactions. Also includes assets that h ave b een pledged supporting Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) activity. 4 Assets suppor ting TD’s long-term funding activities, assets pledged against securitization liabilities, and assets held by consolidated securitization vehicles or in pools for covered bond issuance. 5 Assets that are cons idered readily available in their current legal form to generate funding or support collateral needs. This category includes reported FHLB assets that remain unutilized and DSAC that are available for collateral purposes however not regularly utilized in practice. 6 Assets that cannot be used to support funding or collateral requirements in their current form. This category includes those assets that are potentially eligibl e as funding program collateral or for pledging to central banks (for example, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation insured mortgages that can be securitized into NHA MBS). 7 Includes trading loan s, securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL and other f inancial assets designated at FVTPL, financial assets at FVOCI, and D SAC. 8 Assets reported in the “Bank-owned assets” column represent the valu e of the loans extended and not the value of the collateral receiv ed. The loan value from the reverse repurchase transactions is deduc ted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double-counting with the on -balance sheet assets. 9 The loan value from the margin loa ns/client activity is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double counting with the on-balance sheet asse ts. 10 Other assets include investment in Schwab, goodwill, other intangibles, land, buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets, deferred tax assets, amounts receivab le from brokers, dealers, and clients, and other assets on the balance sheet not reported in the above categories. In addition to the Severe Combined Stress Scenario, the Bank performs liquidity stress testing on multiple alternate scenarios. These scenarios are a mix of TD specific events and market-wide stress events designed to test the impact from risk factors material to the Bank’s risk profile. Liquidity assessments are also part of the Bank’s Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing program. The Bank has liquidity contingency funding plans (CFP) in place at the overall Bank level and for certain subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions (Regional CFPs). The Bank’s CFP prov ides a documented framework for managing unexpected liquidity situations and thus is an integral component of the Bank’s ove rall liq uidity risk management program. It outlines different contingency levels based on the severity and duration of the liquidity situation and identifies recovery action s appropriate for each level. For each recovery action, it provides key operational steps required to execute the action. Regional CFPs identify recovery actions to address region-specific stress events. The actions and governance structure outlined in the Bank’s CFP are aligned with the Bank’s Crisis Management Recovery Plan. Credit ratings impact the Bank’s borrowing costs and ability to raise funds. Rating downgrades could potentially result in higher financing costs, increased requirements to pledge collateral, reduced access to capital markets, and could also affect the Bank’s ability to enter into derivative transactions. Credit ratings and outlooks provided by rating agencies reflect their views and are subject to change from time-to-time, based on a number of factors including the Bank’s financial strength, competitive position, and liquidity, as well as factors not entirely within the Bank’s control, including the methodologies used by rating ag encies and conditions affecting the overall financial services industry.

These activities include clearing, custody, or cash management servi ces. 7 Includes uncommitted credit and liquidity facilities, stable value money market mutual funds, outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity gr eater than 30 days, and other contractual cash ou tflows. With respect to outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, TD has no contractual oblig ation to buy back these outstanding TD debt securities, and as a result, a 0% outflow rate is applied under the OSFI LAR guideline. 8 Total HQLA includes both asset haircuts and ap plicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LA R gui deline (HQLA assets after haircuts are capped at 40% for Level 2 and 15% for Level 2B). 9 Total Ne t Cash Outflows include both inflow and outflow rates and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (inflows are capped at 75% of outflows). The Bank’s average LCR of 144% for the quarter ended April 30, 2023 continues to meet the regulatory requirements. The Bank holds a variety of liquid assets commensurate with the liquidity needs of the organization. Many of these assets qualify as HQLA under the OSFI LAR guideline. The average HQLA of the Bank for the quarter ended April 30, 2023 was $347 billion (January 31, 2023 – $355 billion), with Level 1 assets representing 86% (January 31, 2023 – 84%). The Bank’s reported HQLA excludes excess HQLA from the U.S. Retail operations, as required by the OSFI LAR guideline, to reflect liquidity transfer considerations between U.S. Retail and its affiliates as a result of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s regulations. By excluding excess HQLA, the U.S. Retail LCR is effectively capped at 100% prior to total Bank consolidation. As described in the “How TD Manages Liquidity Risk” section of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report, the Bank manages its HQLA and other liquidity buffers to the higher of TD ’s 90-day surplus requirement and the target buffers over regulatory requirements from the LC R, NSFR, and t he Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) metri cs. As a result, the total stock of HQLA is subject to ongoing rebalancing against the projected liquidity requirements. he NSFR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of total available stable funding (ASF) over total required stable funding (RSF) in accordance with OSFI’s LAR guideline. The Bank must maintain an NSFR ratio equal to or above 100% in accordance with the LAR guideline. The Bank’s ASF comprises the Bank’s liability and capital instruments (including deposits and wholesale funding). The assets that require stable funding are based on the Bank’s on and off-balance sheet activities and a function of their liquidity characteristics and the requirements of OSFI’s LAR guideline TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

These activities include clearing, custody, or cash management services. 5 Interdependent asset and liability items are deemed by OSFI to be interdep endent and have RSF and ASF risk factors adjusted to zero. Interdependent liabilities cannot fall due while the asset is still on balan ce sheet, cannot be used to fund any oth er assets and principal payments from the asset cannot be used for anything other than repaying the liability. As such, the only interdependent assets and liabilities that qual ify for this treatment at the Bank are the liabilities a rising from the Canada Mortgage Bonds Program and their corresponding encumbered assets. 6 I ncludes Residential Mortgages and HELOCs. The B ank’s NSFR for the quarter ended April 30, 2023 is at 122% (October 31, 2022 – 122%) and has met the regulatory requirements. The NSFR changes quarter-to-quarter are based on a number of factors including deposit and loan growth, changes in capital levels, wholesale funding issuance and maturities, and changes in the maturity profile of wholesale funding.

The Bank maintains various registered external wholesale term (greater than 1 year) funding programs to provide access to diversified funding sources, including asset securitization, covered bonds, and unsecured wholesale debt. The Bank raises term funding through Senior Notes, NHA MBS, and notes backed by c redit c ard receivables (Evergreen C redit Card Trust) and home equity lines of credit (Genesis Trust II). The Bank’s wholesale funding is diversified by geography, by currency, and by funding types. The Bank raises short-term (1 year or less) funding using certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and bankers’ acceptances. The B ank maintains depositor concentration limits in respect of short-term wholesale deposits so that it is not overl y reliant on individual depositors for funding. The Bank further limits short-term wholesale funding maturity concentration in an effort to mitigate refinancing risk during a stress event. Page 42 The Bank has access to a var iety of unsecured and secured funding sources. The Bank’s funding activities are conducted in accordance with liquidity risk management policies that require assets be funded to t he appropriate term and to a prudent diversification profile. The Bank’s primary approach to managing funding activities is to maximize the use of deposits raised through personal and commercial banking channels. The following table illustrates the Bank’s large base of personal and commercial, wealth, and Schwab sweep deposits (collectively, “P&C deposits”) that make up approximately 70% of the Bank’s total funding.

Excluding the Wholesale Banking residential mortgage trading business, the Bank’s total mortgage-backed securities issued to external investors for the three and six months ended April 30, 2023 was $0.4 billion and $0.8 billion (three and six months ended April 30, 2022 – $0.5 billion and $0.9 billion) and other asset-backed secu rities issued for the three and six months ended April 30, 2023 was $0.1 billion and $0.4 billion (three and six months ended April 30, 2022 – nil). The Bank also issued $1.0 billion and $13.9 billion of unsecured medium-term notes for the three and six months ended April 30, 2023 (three and six months ended April 30, 2022 – $14.6 billion and $22.3 billion) and $9.7 billion of covered bonds for the three and six months ended April 30, 2023 (three and six months ended April 30, 2022 – $7.6 billion). In January 2022, OSFI published finalized updates to its LAR guideline, following a public consultation period that began in March 2021. The primary changes to the LAR involve enhancements to the NCCF super visory tool to improve the risk sensitivity of the metric. Other significant changes include the addition of contin gencies for undrawn loan commitments, changes to certain loan cash inflows, and the adjustment of deposit runoff factors. The new LAR guideline has been implemented as of April 2023. MATURITY ANALYSIS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet categories by remaining contractual maturity. Off-balance sheet commitments include contractual obligations to make future payments on certain lease-related commitments, certain purchase obligations, and other liabilities. The values of credit instruments reported in the following table represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the Bank could be obligated to extend should such instruments be fully drawn or utilized. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contractual amounts is not representative of expected future liquidity requirements. These contractual obligations have an impact on the Bank’s short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The maturity analysis presented does not depict the degree of the Bank’s maturity transformation or the Bank’s exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk. The Ban k ensures that assets are appropriately funded to protect against borrowing cost volatility and potential reductions to funding market availability. The Bank utilizes stable non-maturity deposits (chequing and savings accounts) and term deposits as the primary source of long-term funding for the Bank’s non-trading assets including personal and business term loans and the stable balance of revolving lines of credit. Additionally, the Bank issues long-term funding in respect of such non-trading assets and raises short term funding primarily to finance trading assets. The liquidity of trading assets under stressed market conditions is consi dered when determining the appropriate term of the funding. TD BANK GROUP • SECOND QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

        "page_content": "Page 46 ATORY DEVELOPMENTS CONCERNING E&S RISK (INCLUDING CLIMATE) On March 7, 2023, OSFI issued Final Guideline B-15: Climate Risk Management (Guideline B-15), which sets out OSFI’s expectations related to the management and disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities. Guideline B-15 is iterative and is currently organized into interrelated and mutually reinforcing chapters, Chapter 1 – Governance and Risk Management Expectations and Chapter 2 – Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Components of Guideline B-15 are initially effective for D-SIBs for fiscal year-end 2024, where annual disclosures are required to be made publicly available no later than 180 days after fiscal year-end. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopting Guideline B-15. SECURITIZATION AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Ba nk enters into securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations. The Bank is involved with structured entities (SEs) that it sponsors, as well as entities sponsored by third parties. Refer to “Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section, Note 9: Transfers of Financial Asset s and Note 10: Structured Entities of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report for further details. There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended April 30, 2023. Se curitization of Third Party-Originated Assets Significant Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities The Bank securitizes third party-originated assets through Bank-sponsored SEs, including its Canadian multi-seller conduits which are not consolidated. These Canadian multi-seller conduits securitize Canadian originated third-party assets. The Bank administers these multi-seller conduits and provides liquidity facilities as well as securities distribution services; it may also provide credit enhancements. TD’s maximum potential exposure to loss due to its ownership interest in commercial paper and through the provision of liquidity facilities for multi-seller conduits was $12.2 billion as at April 30, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $10.8 billion). In additio n, as at April 30, 2023, the Bank had committed to provide $2.2 billion in liquidity facilities that can be used to support future asset-backed commercial paper in the purchase of deal-specific assets (October 31, 2022 – $2.1 billion). Off-Balance Sheet Exposure to Third Party-Sponsored Conduits The Bank has off-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits arising from providing liquidity facilities and funding commitments of $3.8 billion as at April 30, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $3.1 billion). The assets within these conduits are comprised of individual notes backed by automotive loan receivables, credit card receivables, equipment receivables and trade receivables. On-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits have been included in the financial statements. The Ba nk’s unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. For details of the Bank’s accounting policies under IFRS, refer to Note 2 of the Bank’s second quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. For details of the Bank’s significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions under IFRS, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s second quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no new accounting policies that have been adopted by the Bank for the three and six months ended April 30, 2023. ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s pol icies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensu re that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adoptin g new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model he ECL model requires the application of estimates and judgment in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Various interest rates and other indices that are deemed to be “benchmarks” (including Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR)) have been, and continue to be, the subject of international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. As a result of the global benchmark reform initiative, efforts to transition away from IBORs to alternative reference rates (ARR) have been continuing in various jurisdictions. Following previous announcements by various regulators, the publication has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and euro LIBOR settings, as well as the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings effective December 31, 2021. Six-month and twelve-month CDOR tenors ceased to be published effective May 17, 20 21. The remaining USD LIBOR settings (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and twelve-month) will cease to be published immediately after June 30, 2023, while the remaining tenors of CDOR (one-month, two-month, and three-month) will cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. The Bank has incorporated these developments into its benchmark rate reform plan. To ensure an orderly transition, the Bank continues to monitor developments and incorporate global working groups’ and regulators’ best practice guidance on transition activities. These activities include, but are not limited to, making ava ilable new products referencing ARRs, preparing to cease the issuance of the residual IBOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy contracts by incorporating appropriate fallback language, and preparing for overall operational readiness. The Bank is in the final stages of USD LIBOR transition and continues to m ake progress on its CDOR transition plan. There were no significant changes to the Bank’s transition risk with respect to the remaining USD LIBOR and CDOR exposures since October 31, 2022. For further details regarding interest rate benchmark reform, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.

        "page_content": "Page 47 The following standard has been issued, but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Los ses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the Bank. OSFI’s related Advisory precludes early adoption. The standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The adoption of IFRS 17 is a significant initiative for the Bank and is supported by a robust governance structure. The Executive Steering Committee includes representation from the Insurance business, Finance, Actuaries, Risk, Technology, and project management teams. Updates are also provided to the TD insurance subsidiary boards, Risk Committee, and Audit Committee of the Bank. The Bank is proceeding with the implementation of a software solution, including data preparation, system testing and configuration, and other implementation efforts accordingly. During the most recent interim period, there have been no changes in the Bank’s policies and procedures and other processes that comprise its internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting.

To arrive at adjus ted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of no te”, from reported results. The items of note relate to items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance. Allowance for Credit Losses: Represent expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. Allowance for credit losses consists of Stage 3 allowance for impaired financial assets and Stage 2 and Stage 1 allowance for performing financial assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals, and impacted by foreign exchange. Amortized Cost: The amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization, using EIRM, of any differences between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. Assets under Administration (AUA): Assets that are beneficially owned by custom ers where the Bank provides services of an adm inistrative nature, such as the collection of investment income and the placing of trades on behalf of the clients (where the client has made his or her own investment selection). The majority of these assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets under Management (AUM): Assets that are beneficially owned by custom ers, managed by the Bank, w here the Bank has discretion to make investment selections on behalf of the client (in accordance with an investment policy). In addition to the TD family of mutual funds, the Bank manages assets on behalf of individuals, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments and foundations. These assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Some assets under management that are also administered by the Bank are included in assets under administration. Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP): A form of com mercial paper that is collateralized by other financial assets. Institutional investors usually purchase such instruments in order to diversify their assets and generate short-term gains. sset-Backed Securities (ABS): A security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or “backed”) by a specified pool of underlying assets. Average Common Equity: Average common equity for the business segments reflects the average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating ca pital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Average Interest-Earning Assets: A non-GAAP financial measure that depicts the Bank’s financial position, and is calculated as the aver age carrying value of depos its with banks, loans and securities based on daily balances for the period ending October 31 in each fiscal year. Basic Earnings per Share (EPS): A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted basic EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Basis Points (bps): A unit equal to 1/100 of 1%. Thus, a 1% change is equal to 100 basis points. Book Value per Share: A measure calculated by dividing common shareholders’ equity by number of common shares at the end of the period. Carrying Value: The value at which an asset or liability is carried at on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO): They are collateralized debt obli gations consisting of mortgage-backed securities that are separated and issued as different classes of mortgage pass-through securities with different terms, interest rates, and risks. CMOs by private issuers are collectively referred to as non-agency CMOs. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: This is a primary Basel III capital measure comprised mainly of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. Regulatory deductions made to arrive at the CET1 Capital include goodwill and intangibles, unconsolidated investments in banking, financial, and insurance entities, deferred tax assets, defined benefit pension fund assets, and shortfalls in allowances. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio: CET1 Capital ratio represents the predominant measure of capital adequacy under Basel III and equals CET1 Capital divided by RWA. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): A measure of growth over multiple time p eriods from the initial investment value to the ending investment value assuming that the investment has been compounding over the time period. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA): CVA represents a capital charge that measures credit risk due to default of derivative counterparties. This charge requires banks to capitalize for the potential changes in counterparty credit spread for the derivative portfolios. Diluted EPS: A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to com mon shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusting for the effect of al l potentially dilutive common shares. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Payout Ratio: A ratio represents the percentage of Bank’s earnings bein g paid to common shareholders in the form of dividends and is calculated by dividing common dividends by net income available to common shareholders. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Yield: A ratio calculated as the dividend per common share for the year divided by the daily average closing stock price during the year. Effective Income Tax Rate: A rate and performance indicator calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes as a per centage of net income before taxes. Adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated in the same manner using adjusted results. Effective Interest Rate (EIR): The rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The ca lc ulation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts. Effective Interest Rate Method (EIRM): A technique for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument’s book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Under EIRM, the effective interest rate, which is a key component of the calculation, discounts the expected future cash inflows and outflows expected over the life of a financial instrument. Efficiency Ratio: The efficiency ratio measures operating efficiency and is cal culated by taking the non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue. A lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted non-interest expenses and total revenue.

Expected Credit Losses (ECLs): ECLs are the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions that impact the Bank’s credit risk assessment. Fair Value: The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transf er a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Under IFRS 9, if the asset passes the contractual cash flows test (named SPPI), the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classified. If the instrument is being held to collect contractual cash flows, that is, if it is not expected to be sold, it is measured as amortized cost. If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is measured at FVOCI. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Under IFRS 9, t he classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI) and a business model assessment. Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at f air value with all changes in fair value reported in profit or loss. Fede ral Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): A U.S. government cor poration which provides deposit insurance guaranteeing the safety of a depositor’s accounts in member banks. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in receiverships (failed banks). Fo rward Contracts: Over-the-counter contracts between two parties that oblige one party to the contract to buy and the other party to sell an asset for a fixed price at a future date. Futures: Exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Hedging: A risk management technique intended to mitigate the Bank’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other market factors. The elimination or reduction of such exposure is accomplished by engaging in capital markets activities to establish offsetting positions. Impaired Loans: Loans where, in management’s op inion, there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent that the Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. Loss Given Default (LGD): It is the amount of the loss the Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a loan, which is expressed as a percentage of exposure at default. Mark-to-Market (MTM): A valuation that reflects current market rates as at the balance sheet date for financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Master Netting Agreements: Legal agreements between two parties that have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default or termination of any one contract. Net Corporate Expenses: Non-interest expenses related to corporate service and control groups which are not allocated to a business segment. Net Interest Margin: A non-GAAP ratio calculated as net interest income as a perc entage of average interest-earning assets to measure performance. This metric is an indicator of the profitability of the Bank’s earning assets less the cost of funding. Adjusted net interest margin is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net interest income. Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC): Instruments (preferred shares and subordinated debt) that contain a feature or a provision that allows the financial institution to either permanently convert these instruments into common shares or fully write-down the instrument, in the event that the institution is no longer viable. Notio nal: A reference amount on which payments for derivative financial instruments are based. Office of the Superintendent of Fi nancial Institutions Canada (OSFI): The reg ulator of Canadian federally chartered financial institutions and federally administered pension plans. Options: Contracts in w hich the writer of the option grants the buyer the future right, but not the obligation, to buy or to sell a security, exchange rate, interest rate, or other financial instrument or commodity at a predetermined price at or by a specified future date. Price-Earnings Ratio: A ratio calculated by dividing the closing share price by EPS base d on a trailing four quarters to indicate market performance. Adjusted price-earnings ratio is c alculated in the same m anner using adjusted EPS. Probab ility of Default (PD): It is the likelihood that a borrower will not be abl e to meet its scheduled repayments. Provision for Credit Losses (PCL): Amount added to the allowance for credit losses to bring it to a level that management considers adequate to reflect expected credit-related losses on its portfolio. Return on Common Equity (ROE): The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity, utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to com mon shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. Adjusted ROE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Return on Risk-weighted Assets: Net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average risk-weighted assets. Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are trea ted as an item of note, as a percentage of average Tangible common equity. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Both measures can be u tilized in assessing t he Bank’s use of equity.

The Bank is incorporated and domiciled in Canada wi th its registered and principal business offices located at 66 Wellington Street Wes t, Toronto, Ontario. TD serves customers in four business segments operating in a number of locations in key financial centres around the globe: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retai l, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The accompanying Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting principles followed by the Bank ha ve been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including the accounting requirements of the Office of t he Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indi cated. These Interi m Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on a condensed basis in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting using the accounting policies as described in Note 2 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain comparative amounts hav e been revised to conform with the presentation adopted in the c urrent period. The preparation of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements requires that management make judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as further described in Note 3 of the B ank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 3 of this report. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future confirming events occur. The Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transa ctions and events in similar circumstances. All intercompany transactions, balances, and unrealized gains and losses on transact ions are eliminated on consolidation. The Interim C onsolidated Financial Statements for the three and six months ended April 30, 2023, were approved and authorized for issue by the Bank’s Board of Directors, in accordance with a recom mendation of the Audit Committee, on May 24, 2023. As the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the disclo sures normally provided in the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, they should be read in conjunc tion with the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes, and the shaded sections of the 2022 Management’ s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The risk management policies and procedures of the Bank are pro vided in the MD&A. The shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the MD&A in this report, relating to market, liquidity, and insurance risks, are an integral par t of these Interim Consolidated Financial Statements , as permitted by IFRS. NOTE 2: CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES here were no new accounting policies that have been adopted by the Bank for the three and six months ended April 30, 2023. The following standard has been issued, but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Insura nce Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance C ontracts (IFRS 1 7) which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts and establishes principles for recognition, measurement , presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated int o groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided ov er the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the Bank. OSFI’s related Advisory precludes early adoption. The standard w ill be applied retrospe ctively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The adoption of IFRS 17 is a significant initiative for the Bank and is supported by a robust governance structure. The Executive Steering Committee includes represent ation from the Insurance business, Finance, Actuaries, Risk, Technology, and project manage ment teams. Updates are also provided to the TD insurance subsidiary boards, Risk Committee, and Audit Committee of the Bank. he Bank is proceeding with the implementation of a software solution, including data preparation, system testing and configuration, and other implementation efforts ac cordingly.

Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to ac counting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank ’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new acc ounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a descriptio n of significant accounting judgments, estimat es, and assumptions. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The expect ed credit loss (ECL) model requires the application of estimates and judgment in the asse ssment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an e xposure has experienced significant increase in credit ris k since initial recognition and in determining t he amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorpor ated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitativ e adjustments have been applied. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Various interest rates and other indices that are deemed to be “benchmarks” (including Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR)) have been, and continue to be, the subjec t of international regulatory guidance and proposal s for reform. As a resultof the global benchmark reform initiative, efforts to transition away from IBORs to alternative reference rates (ARR) have been continuing in various jurisdictions. Following prev ious announcements by various regulators, the publication has ceased for all sterling, J apanese yen, Swiss franc and euro LIBOR settings, as well as the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings effective December 31, 2021. Six-month and twelve-month CDOR tenors ceased to be published ef fective May 17, 2021. The remaining USD LIBOR settings (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and twelve-month) will cease to be published immediately after June 30, 2023, while the remaining tenors of CDOR (one-m onth, two-month, and three-month) will cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. The Bank has incorporated these developments into its benchmark rate reform plan. To ensure an orderly transition, the Bank continues to monitor developments and incorporate global working groups’ and regulators’ best practice guidance on transition activities. These activities include, but are not limit ed to, making available new products referencing ARRs, preparing to cease the issuance of the residual IBOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy contracts by incorporating appro priate fallback language, and preparing for overall operational readiness. The Bank is in the final s tages of USD LIBOR transition and continues to make progress on it s CDOR transition plan. There were no significant changes to the Bank’s transition risk with respect to the remaining USD LIBOR and CDOR exposures since October 31,2022. For further details regarding interest rate benchmark reform, refer to Note 3 of t he Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.

        "page_content": "- - - P a g e 7 1 (e) FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Relevant macroeconomic factors are incorporated in risk parameters as appropriate. Ad ditional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. The key macroeconomic variables used in determining EC Ls include regional unemployment rates for all retail exp osures and regional housing price indices for residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. F or business and government loans, the key macroeconomic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, and credit spreads. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of how forward-looking information is generated and considered in determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and in measuring ECLs. Macroecon omic Variables Select macroeconomic variables are projected over the forecast period. The following table represents the average values of the mac roeconomic variables over the four calend ar quarters starting with the current quarter, and the remaining 4-year forecast period for the base forecast and upside and downside scenarios used in deter mining the Bank’s ECLs as at April 30, 2023. As the forecast period increases, information about the future becomes less readily available and projections are anchored on as sumptions around structural relationships between economic parameters that are inherently much less certain. Ongoing geopolitical tensions, and heigh tened inflationary pressures, which have led to a rapid tightening in monetary p olicy continue to contribute to elevated economic uncertainty, leading to deterioration in our economic forecasts.

(f) SENSITIVITY OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ECLs are sensitive to the inputs used in internally developed models, the macroeconomic variables in the forward-looking forecasts and respecti ve probability weightings in det ermining the probability-w eighted ECLs, and other factor s considered when applying expert credit judgment. Changes in th ese inputs, assumptions, models, and judgments would affect the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the measurem ent of ECLs. The following table presents the base ECL scenario compared to the probability-weighted ECLs, with the latter derived from three ECL scenarios for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The difference reflects the impact of deriving m ultiple scenarios around the base ECLs and resultant change in ECLs due to non-linea rity and sensitivity to using m acroeconomic forecasts. Change from Base to Probability-Weighted ECLs (millions of C anadian dollars, except as noted) As at April 30, 2023 October 31, 2022 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 6,782 $ 6,599 Base EC Ls 6,303 6,09 5 Difference – in amount $ 479 $ 504 Difference – in percentage 7.6 % 8.3 % ECLs for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments consist of an aggregate amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 probability-weighted ECLs which are twelve- month ECLs and lifetime ECLs, respectively.

The Bank does not generally occupy foreclosed properties for its business use. The Bank predo minantly relies on third-party appraisals to determine the carrying value of foreclosed assets. Foreclosed assets he ld for sale were $56 million as at April 30, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $51 million), and were recorded in Other assets on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet.

As at April 30, 2023, the Bank’s reported investment in Schwab was approximately 12.4% (October 31, 2022 – 12.1%), con sisting of 9.9% of the outstanding voting common shares and the remainder in non-voting common shares of Schwab with a f air value of $16 billion (US$12 billion) (Octob er 31, 2022 – $24 billion (US$18 billi on)) based on the c losing price of US$52.24 (O ctober 31, 2022 – US$79.67) on the New York S tock Exchange. The Bank and Schwab are party to a stockholder agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”) under which the Bank has the right to designate two members of Schwab’s Board of Directors and has representation on two Board Committees, subject to the Bank meeting certain conditions. The Bank’s designated directors currently are the Bank’s Group President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank’s Chair of the Board.

        "page_content": "P a g e 7 3 IDA Agreement On November 25, 2019, the Bank and Schwab signed an insured deposit account agreement (“2019 Schwab IDA Agreement”), with an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. Pursuant to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank made sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Sc hwab. Starting July 1, 2021, Sch wab had the opti on to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuat e over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into an amended insured deposit account agreement (the “2023 Schwab IDA Agreement”), which replaced the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by three years to J uly 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until September 2025, the aggreg ate amount of fixed rate obligations will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to US$5 billion of fixed rate obligations by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to certain limits. NOTE 8: S Acquisiti on of Cowen Inc. On March 1, 2023, the Bank completed the acquisition of Cowen Inc. (“Cowen”). The acquisition advances the Wholesale Banking Segment’s lon g-term growth strategy in the U.S. and adds complementary products and services to the Bank’s existing businesses. The results of the acquired business have been consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and primarily reported in the Wholes ale Banking segment. Consideration included $1,500 million (US$1,100 m illion) in cash for 100% of Cowen’s co mmon shares outstanding, $253 million (US$186 million) for the settlement of Cowen’s Series A Preferred Stock, and $205 million (US$151 million) related to the replace ment of share-based payment awards. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method. As at March 1, 20 23, the acquisition contributed $10,848 million (US$7,970 million) of assets and $9,900 million (US$7,275 million) of liabilities. The excess of accounting consideration over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired was allocated to other int angibles assets of $312 million (US$229 million) net of taxes, and goodwill of $ 698 million (US$513 million). Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation may be adjusted dur ing the measurement period, which shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquis ition date. Since the acquisition date, the contribution of Cowen to th e Bank’s revenue and net income was not significant, nor would it have been significant if the acquisition had occurred as of November 1, 2022. The Bank plan s to dispose of certain non-core businesses that were acquired in connection with the Cowen acquisition. These non-core businesses are disposal groups which meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The ass ets and liabilities of these disposal groups are recorded in O ther assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet. As at April 30, 2023, a ssets of $1,493 million and liabilities of $860 million were classified as held for sale.

This bill enacted the Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD) and increased the Canadian federal tax rate for bank and life insurer groups by 1.5%. The implementation of the CRD resulted in a provision for income taxes of $553 million and a charge to OCI of $239 million, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the Canadian federal tax rate of 1.5%, prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, resulted in a provision for income taxes of $82 million and a tax benefit of $75 million in OCI related to fiscal 2022, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank also remeasured certain Canadian deferred tax as sets and liabilities for the increase in tax rate, which resulted in an increase in net deferred tax assets of $50 million, which is recorded in prov ision for income taxes.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the same method as basic earnings per share except that certain adjustments are made to net income attributable to common shareholders and the weighted-average number of shares outs tanding for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares that are assumed to be issu ed by the Bank. The following table presents the Bank’s basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022. Bas ic and Diluted Earnings Per Share (millions of C anadian dollars, except as noted) For the three months ended For the six months ended April 30 2023 April 30 2022 April 30 2023 April 30 2022 Basic earnings per share Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,141 $ 3,745 $ 4, 640 $ 7,435 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (millions) 1,828.3 1,804.7 1,824. 4 1,812.8 Basic earnings per share (Canadian dollars) $ 1.72 $ 2.08 $ 2.54 $ 4.10 iluted earnings per share Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,141 $ 3,745 $ 4, 640 $ 7,435 Net income available to common shareholders including impact of dilutive securities 3,141 3,745 4,640 7,435 Weighted-ave rage number of common shares outstanding (millions) 1,828.3 1,804.7 1,824. 4 1,812.8 Effect of dilutive securities Stock options potentially exercisable (millions)1 2.0 3.6 2.2 3.7 Weighted-a verage number of common shares outstanding – diluted (milli ons) 1,830.3 1,808.3 1,826. 6 1,816.5 Diluted earnings per share (Canadian dollars)1 $ 1.72 $ 2.07 $ 2.54 $ 4.09 1 For the three and six months ended April 30, 2023, the computation of diluted earnings per share excluded average options outstanding of 4.9 million and 4.2 million, respectively, with a weighted- average exercise price of $92.89 and $93.29, respectively, as the option price was greater than the average market pr ice of the Bank’s common shares. For the three and six months ended April 30, 20 22, no outstanding options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. NOTE 18 : CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Other than as described below, there have been no new signifi cant events or transactions as previously iden tified in Note 27 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank and its subsidia ries are involved in vario us legal and regulatory a ctions, including but not limited to civil claim s and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits, and requests for information by governmental, regulatory and self-regulatory agencies and law enforcement aut horities in various jurisdictions. The Bank establishes provisions when it becomes probable that the Bank will incur a loss and the amount can be reliably estimated. The Bank also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) in its legal and regulatory actions (that is, those which are neither probable nor remote), in excess of provisions. As at April 30, 2023, the Bank’s RPL is from zero to approximately $1.27 billion (October 31, 2022 – from zero to approximately $1.26 billion). The Bank’s provisions and RPL represent the Bank’s best estimates based upon currently available information for actions for which estimates can be made, but there are a number of f actors that could cause the Bank’s provisions and/or RPL to be significantly different from its actual or RPL. For ex ample, the Bank’s estimates involve significant judgment due to the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defen dants in many proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the pr oceedings, some of which are beyond the Bank’s control a nd/or involve novel legal theories and interpretation s, the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proc eedings, and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. In addition, some actions seek very large or indeterminate damages. In management’s opinion, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the ultimate disposition of these actio ns, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidat ed financial condition or the consolidated cash flows of the Bank. However, because of the factors listed above, as well as other uncertaintie s inherent in litigation and regulatory matters, there is a possibility that the ultimate resolution of legal or regulatory actions may be material to the Bank’s consolidated results of operations for any particular reporting period. Stanford Liti gation – In the US Rotst ain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. action, on F ebruary 24, 2023, the Bank reached a settlement in principle (the “settlement” or “agreement”) pursuant to which the Bank agreed to pay US$1.205 billion to Ralph S. Janvey, solely in his capacity as the court-appointed receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate, to resolve claims brought by the Official Stanford Investors Committee and the plaintiffs in the Rotstain v. Trustm ark National Bank, et al. and Smith v. Independent Bank, et al. actions. As a result of this agreement, the Bank recorded a provision of approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax ($1.2 billion after-tax)in the first quar ter of 2023. Under the t erms of the agreement, all involved parties have agreed to a bar order dismissing and releasing all current or future claim s arising fromor related to Stanford. The settlementis subject to court approval. On March 7, 2023, the parties finalized their settlement agreement, and on March 8, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to approve the s ettlement in the multi district litigation court in the Northern District of Texas. On March 14, 2023, that Court preliminarily found that the terms of the settle ment agreement are adequate, fair, reasonable, and equitable and scheduled a final settlement approval hearing for August 8, 2023. A case regarding the same facts was also brought in Ontario by the Joint Liquidators of Stanford International Bank Ltd. appointed by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court , under the title McDonald v. The Toronto-Dominion Bank. That ac tion was dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on J une 8, 2021, following a trial earlier in 2021. On November 17, 2022, the Court of Appeal for Ontario issued a unanimous written decision which dismissed the appeal and affirmed the trial decision. On January 16, 2023, the Joint Liquidators filed an application f or leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Bank filed a response to the leave application on February 22, 2023.

NOTE 21: R The Bank manages its capital under guidelines established by OSFI. The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to credi t, market, and operational risks. The Bank has various capital policies, procedures, and controls which it utilizes to achieve its goals and objectives. On November 22, 2019, the Bank was designated a global s ystemically important bank (G-SIB). Effective January 1, 2016, OSFI’s target Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios for Canadian banks designated as domestic sy stemically important banks (D-SIBs) inc ludes a 1% common equity capital surcharge bringing the tar gets to 8%, 9.5%, and 11.5%, r espectively. On June 25, 2018, OSFI provided greater transparency related to previousl y undisclosed Pillar 2 CET1 capital buffers through the introduction of the public D omestic Stability Buffer (DSB) which is held by D-SIBs a gainst Pillar 2 risks. The current published buffer is set at 3.0% of t otal risk-weighted assets (RWA) and must be met with CET1 Capital, effectively raising OSFI’s publis hed CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capit al minimum target ratios to 11%, 12.5%, and 14.5%, respectively. The OSFI target includes the greaterof the D-SIBor G-SI B surcharge, both of which are currently 1%. On September 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). Under this guideline, the Bank was required to m eet a supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.5% of RWA, in clusive of the 3.0% DSB, and a TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75% by Nov ember 1, 2021. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio. On February 1, 2023, OSFI implemented revised capital rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. These revised rules include revisions to the calculation of credit risk and operational risk requirements, and revisions to the Lev erage Requirements Guideline to include a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ra tio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the regulatory minimum requirement of 3.0%. This buff er will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio supervisory target of 6.75%. During the six months ended April 30, 2023, the Bank complied with the OSFI Basel III guidelines related to risk-based and leverage capital ratios.

Under the terms of the termina tion agreement, the Bank made a US$225 million cash payment to First Hori zon on May 5, 2023. The termination payment will be reported w ithin the Corporate segment financial results for the third quarter ending July 31, 2023. In connection with the transaction, the Bank had invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock. During the current quarter, the Bank recognized a valuation adjustment loss of $199 million on this inv estment based on First Horizon’s common share price at the end of the quarter , recorded in Other Comprehensiv e Income. In accordance with the preferred shares purchase agreement and the terms of the preferred stock, subject to certain conditions, the preferred stock will convert into approximately 19.7 million common shares of First Ho rizon in the third quarter. Prior to the announce ment on May 4, 2023 to terminate the merger agreement, the Bank had implemented a strategy to mitigate the impact of interest rate volatility to c apital on closing of the acquisition. The Bank d etermined that the fair value of First Hori zon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets would have been sensitiv e to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets would have determined the amount of goodwill to be re cognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and inta ngibles would have negatively impacted capital ratios because they are deducted fro m capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate t his volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated c ertain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships. As a result of the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps were recognized in earnings, wi thout any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) would have mitigated the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investmen ts. For the three months and six months ended April 30, 2023, t he Bank reported ($263) million and ($1,261) milli on, respectively, in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $129 million and $251 million, respectively, in net intere st income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the three months and six months ended April 30, 2023, the Bank reported $311 million and $562 million, respectively, in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps. Following the announcement on May 4, 2023 to t erminate the merger agreement, the Bank discontinued this strategy and reinstated hedge accounting on the portfolio of fix ed income investments.
