        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 6 SIGNIFICANT AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, AND PENDING ACQUISITIONS Acquisition of Cowen Inc. On August 2, 2022, the Bank and Cowen Inc. (“Cowen”) announced a definitive agreement for TD to acquire Cowen in an all-cash transaction valued at US$1.3 billion, or US$39.00 for each share of Cowen common stock. The transaction is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from Cowen’s stockholders and certain U.S., Canadian, and foreign regulatory authorities. The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and reported in the Wholesale Banking segment. Based on the estimated financial performance and balance sheets of the Bank and Cowen, including transaction-related impacts, the Bank expects that its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio will be comfortably above 11% upon the closing of the Cowen acquisition, pro forma for the closing of the Bank’s acquisition of First Horizon Corporation (“First Horizon”). Sale of Schwab Common Shares On August 1, 2022, in order to provide the capital required for the acquisition of Cowen, the Bank sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Schwab at a price of US$66.53 per share for proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion (US$1.9 billion). Approximately 15 million shares were sold to Schwab pursuant to a repurchase agreement at a price equal to the price obtained in the sale of 13.4 million shares sold to a broker dealer pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933. All shares sold automatically converted into shares of Schwab voting common stock and the shares acquired by Schwab are no longer outstanding. The sales reduced the Bank’s ownership interest in Schwab from approximately 13.4% to 12.0%. The Bank is expected to recognize approximately $1 billion (US$770 million) as other income (net of $370 million (US$290 million) loss from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) reclassified to earnings), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Acquisition of First Horizon Corporation On February 28, 2022, the Bank and First Horizon announced a definitive agreement for the Bank to acquire First Horizon in an all-cash transaction valued at US$13.4 billion, or US$25.00 for each common share of First Horizon. In connection with this transaction, the Bank has invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock (convertible in certain circumstances into up to 4.9% of First Horizon’s common stock). The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from First Horizon’s shareholders and U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities. The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and reported in the U.S. Retail segment. If the transaction does not close prior to November 27, 2022, First Horizon shareholders will receive, at closing, an additional US$0.65 per share on an annualized basis for the period from November 27, 2022 through the day immediately prior to the closing. Either party will have the right to terminate the agreement if the transaction has not closed by February 27, 2023 (the “outside date”), subject to the right of either party (under certain conditions) to extend the outside date to May 27, 2023. During the quarter, the Bank implemented a strategy to mitigate interest rate volatility to capital on closing of the acquisition. The fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets are sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets will determine the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles will negatively impact capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships. After the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps are being recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments, which will mitigate the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022, the Bank recognized $(721) million in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $43 million in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization.",
        "summary": "TD Bank Group announced two significant acquisitions in 2022. First, it plans to acquire Cowen Inc. for $1.3 billion in an all-cash transaction, expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. This acquisition will be consolidated into TD's Wholesale Banking segment, and the bank anticipates maintaining a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio above 11% post-acquisition. To fund this purchase, TD sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Schwab, reducing its ownership from 13.4% to 12%, and expects to recognize $1 billion in other income in Q4 2022.\n\nAdditionally, TD is acquiring First Horizon Corporation for $13.4 billion, with the transaction also expected to close in early 2023. This acquisition will be integrated into TD's U.S. Retail segment. The bank has taken steps to mitigate interest rate volatility affecting capital ratios by de-designating certain interest rate swaps, resulting in a $721 million non-interest income loss and a $43 million net interest income gain for the period ending July 31, 2022. If the First Horizon deal does not close by November 27, 2022, shareholders will receive an additional payment, and the agreement may be terminated if not completed by February 27, 2023, with a possible extension to May 27, 2023."

TD is the sixth largest bank in North America by assets and serves more than 27 million customers in three key businesses operating in a number of locations in financial centres around the globe: Canadian Retail, including TD Canada Trust, TD Auto Finance Canada, TD Wealth (Canada), TD Direct Investing, and TD Insurance; U.S. Retail, including TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank®, TD Auto Finance U.S., TD Wealth (U.S.), and an investment in Schwab; and Wholesale Banking, including TD Securities. TD also ranks among the world’s leading online financial services firms, with more than 15 million active online and mobile customers. TD had $1.8 trillion in assets on July 31, 2022. The Toronto-Dominion Bank trades under the symbol “TD” on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges. The Bank prepares its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS and refers to results prepared in accordance with IFRS as “reported” results. Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures In addition to reported results, the Bank also presents certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures that are historical, non-GAAP ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures, to assess its results. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as “adjusted” results, are utilized to assess the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts reported results for “items of note”. Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP ratios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the Bank’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. Supplementary financial measures depict the Bank’s financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the Bank’s capital position, and both are explained in this document where they first appear. U.S. Strategic Cards The Bank’s U.S. strategic cards portfolio is comprised of agreements with certain U.S. retailers pursuant to which TD is the U.S. issuer of private label and co branded consumer credit cards to their U.S. customers. Under the terms of the individual agreements, the Bank and the retailers share in the profits generated by the relevant portfolios after credit losses. Under IFRS, TD is required to present the gross amount of revenue and PCL related to these portfolios in the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Statement of Income. At the segment level, the retailer program partners’ share of revenues and credit losses is presented in the Corporate segment, with an offsetting amount (representing the partners’ net share) recorded in Non-interest expenses, resulting in no impact to Corporate’s reported Net income (loss). The Net income (loss) included in the U.S. Retail segment includes only the portion of revenue and credit losses attributable to TD under the agreements. Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation On October 6, 2020, the Bank acquired an approximately 13.5% stake in Schwab following the completion of Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade (“Schwab transaction”). For further details, refer to Note 7 of the third quarter of 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method and reports its after-tax share of Schwab’s earnings with a one-month lag. The U.S. Retail segment reflects the Bank’s share of net income from its investment in Schwab. The Corporate segment net income (loss) includes amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction.

Return on Common Equity The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. The consolidated Bank adjusted ROE is calculated as adjusted net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. Adjusted ROE is a non-GAAP financial ratio and can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Capital allocated to the business segments increased to 10.5% CET1 Capital in the first quarter of 2022, compared with 9% in fiscal 2021.

ROTCE is calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a percentage of average TCE. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated using reported net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for all items of note, as a percentage of average TCE. TCE, ROTCE, and adjusted ROTCE can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. TCE is a non-GAAP financial measure, and ROTCE and adjusted ROTCE are non-GAAP ratios.

Performance Summary Outlined below is an overview of the Bank’s performance for the third quarter of 2022. Shareholder performance indicators help guide and benchmark the Bank’s accomplishments. For the purposes of this analysis, the Bank utilizes adjusted earnings, which excludes items of note from the reported results that are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Reported and adjusted results and items of note are explained in “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in the “How We Performed” section of this document. • Adjusted diluted EPS for the nine months ended July 31, 2022, increased 6% from the same period last year. • Adjusted ROTCE for the nine months ended July 31, 2022, was 21.2%. • For the twelve months ended July 31, 2022, the total shareholder return was 4.2% compared to the Canadian peer 2 average of 2.1%. Net Income Quarterly comparison – Q3 2022 vs. Q3 2021 Reported net income for the quarter was $3,214 million, a decrease of $331 million, or 9%, compared with the third quarter last year primarily reflecting the net loss from mitigation of interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $3,813 million, an increase of $185 million, or 5%, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses and higher PCL. By segment, the decrease in reported net income reflects a decrease in the Corporate segment of $547 million and a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $59 million, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Retail of $147 million and an increase in Canadian Retail of $128 million. Quarterly comparison – Q3 2022 vs. Q2 2022 Reported net income for the quarter decreased $597 million, or 16%, compared with the prior quarter primarily reflecting the net loss from mitigation of interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition. Adjusted net income for the quarter increased $99 million, or 3%, reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by higher PCL, higher insurance claims and higher non-interest expenses. By segment, the decrease in reported net income reflects a decrease in the Corporate segment of $601 million and a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $88 million, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Retail of $75 million and an increase in Canadian Retail of $17 million. Year-to-date comparison – Q3 2022 vs. Q3 2021 Reported net income of $10,758 million increased $241 million, or 2%, compared with the same period last year. The increase reflects higher revenues, and an insurance recovery related to litigation, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses, the net loss from mitigation of interest rate volatility to closing capital on First Horizon acquisition, higher PCL and higher insurance claims. Adjusted net income was $11,360 million, an increase of $577 million, or 5%, compared with the same period last year. By segment, the increase in reported net income reflects an increase in U.S. Retail of $470 million and an increase in Canadian Retail of $399 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Corporate segment of $542 million and a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $86 million. Net Interest Income Quarterly comparison – Q3 2022 vs. Q3 2021 Reported net interest income for the quarter was $7,044 million, an increase of $1,040 million, or 17%, compared with the third quarter last year. The increase reflects margin and volume growth in the personal and commercial banking businesses, the impact of foreign exchange translation and higher net interest income in Wholesale Banking, partially offset by lower income from PPP loan forgiveness. Adjusted net interest income was $7,001 million, an increase of $997 million, or 17%. 2 Canadian peers include Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Bank of Nova Scotia.",

Income Taxes As discussed in “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in the “How We Performed” section of this document, the Bank adjusts its reported results to assess each of its businesses and to measure overall Bank performance. As such, the provision for income taxes is stated on a reported and an adjusted basis. The Bank’s effective income tax rate on a reported basis was 19.3% for the current quarter, lower than 21.5% in the third quarter last year and 21.7% in the prior quarter primarily due to lower pre-tax income and net favourable tax adjustments in the current quarter. To allow for an after-tax calculation of adjusted income, the adjusted provision for income taxes is calculated by adjusting the taxes for each item of note using the statutory income tax rate of the applicable legal entity. The adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes before other taxes as a percentage of adjusted net income before taxes. The Bank’s adjusted effective income tax rate was 20.3% for the current quarter, lower than",

Pr oposed Tax Measures in the Canadian Federal Budget The Canadian Federal budget presented on A pril 7, 2022, proposed to in troduce a tax on bank and life insurer groups, referred to as t he Canada Recovery Dividend (“CRD”), and also an additional permanent tax. On August 9, 2022, the first draft of the legislation was released by the Ministry of Finance. This draft legislation proposes the CRD to be a 15% tax on an average of 2020 and 2021 taxable income above $1 billion, paid in equal instalments over five years. The draft legislation also proposes to i ntroduce an additional permanent tax on bank and life insurer groups of 1.5% of taxable income above $100 million. The additional tax would apply to taxation years that end after April 7, 2022 and will be prorated for the first year. These taxes, if enacted as proposed, will result in higher amounts of taxes payable in each of the impacted years, as well as revaluation adjustments to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Bank is continuing to monitor the status of the Budget proposals and draft legislation, and will determine the impact to the Ban k’s results when the legislation is substantively enacted. The outlook for the global economy for the next two years has been do wngraded relative to last quarter. Inflation around the world has been stronger-than expe cted leading to a more aggressive response by central banks. Several global central banks are raising interest rates at a rapid pace to s low demand and bri ng down inflationary pressures. Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine is keeping prices for many commodities elevated. In ad dition, China’s “zero COVID” policy continues to nega tively impact the global economy and risk sentiment with ongoing restrictions within densely populated areas of the country restraining economic activity and continuing to disrupt downstream supply chains in many industries. Although COVID-19 is imparting fewer disruptions on the North American economy as time goes on, the combination of slowing global demand, high domestic inflation, and the rapid rise in interest rates has raised the likelihood of a recession over the next twelve to twenty-four months. U.S. economic output contracted in the first two quarters of 2022. While that is often referred to as a “technical” recession, most economic indicators in the first half of the year do not suggest the economy had broadly deteriorated into recessionary conditions. For example, a hallmark of re cessions is an increase in the unemployment rate. In contrast, the unemployment rate fell from 4% at the beginning of the year back down to its pre-pandemic low of 3.5% in July. That said, economic momentum is weakening into the second half of the year. Inflation has shown early signs of c resting but was still near a 40-year high at 8.5% year over year in July. High inflation is weighing on purchasing power as evidenced by a slowdown in consumer spending growth from an ann ualized rate of 2.3% in the second half of 2021 to a sub-par 1.4% in the first half of 2022. Spending on goods is also normalizing after surging earlier in the pandemic. The Federal Reserve has accelerated the pace of r ate hikes to fight persistently high inflation, raising the Federal Funds rate by an outsized 75 basis points (bps) in both June and July, to 2.50%, in addition to beginning to taper the size of its balance sheet. TD Economics expects further interest rate hikes will take the Fed eral Funds rate to 3.25% before the end of the calendar year. There is a risk that the economy will slow more quickly than the Federal Reserve expects trigg ering an outright recession. Financial markets have reflected this risk with segments of the yield curve inverting. he Canadian economy has stood out on the global stage in the first half of the year, growing at a very healthy pace. Growth has been helped by several forces. more complete return to pandemic-affected activities has driven spending higher, and higher commodity prices have also boosted activity in resource sectors. Finally, in contrast to the U.S., government spending has continued to expand. The Canadian labour market has been similarly strong, with the unemployment rate falling to a new low of 4.9% amid accelerating wage growth. However, there are signs that momentum has slowed towards the end of the second calendar quarter. The first area of the economy to slow was the housing market, where home sales are do wn 31% between July and the peak in February of this year. Average pric es have fallen 17% from the peak. As the Bank of Canada continues to raise rates, the corresponding increase in m ortgage rates is expected to slow housing dem and further over the next year. Housing prices are likely to continue to soften in the second half of the year but remain above pre- pandemic levels. Canadian inflation has accelerated to be much closer to the U.S. pace. Consumer Price Index inflation in Canada was 7.6% year over year in July 2022. Given Canada’s strong economic momentum and the recent broadening in inflation pressures, inflation is li kely to ease only slightly through 2022. The Bank of Canada raised its overnight interest rate 50 bps in June and a full percentage point in July, taking the overnight rate to 2.50%. TD Economics expects the overnight rate to reach 3.25% by the end of the year, with the risks tilted towards higher policy rates. With interest rates set to in crease by a similar amount in Canada and the United States, the Canadian dollar is expected to remain in a range of 75-80 U.S. cents over the next two years.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial and economic insights:\n\n1. **Income Taxes**: The effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 19.3% on a reported basis and 20.3% on an adjusted basis, with adjustments primarily due to net favorable tax adjustments. Proposed Canadian federal tax measures could increase future tax liabilities for banks and insurers.\n\n2. **Global Economic Outlook**: The global economic outlook has been downgraded due to stronger-than-expected inflation, aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions such as Russia's war in Ukraine. These factors are raising the likelihood of a recession in the next 12 to 24 months.\n\n3. **U.S. Economy**: The U.S. experienced a technical recession with economic output contracting in the first two quarters of 2022, although unemployment rates remained low. Inflation remains high, impacting consumer spending, and the Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising interest rates.\n\n4. **Canadian Economy**: Canada showed strong economic growth in the first half of the year, driven by a return to pre-pandemic activities, high commodity prices, and government spending. However, the housing market is slowing, and inflation is high, prompting the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates.\n\n5. **Interest Rates and Currency**: Both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada are expected to continue raising interest rates, potentially reaching 3.25% by the end of the year. The Canadian dollar is expected to remain stable against the U.S. dollar in the range of 75-80 cents over the next two years."

The Bank’s other activities are grouped into the Corporate segment. Results of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the Bank measures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments, the Bank indicates that the measure is adjusted. For further details, refer to the “How We Performed” section of this document, the “Business Focus” section in the Bank’s 2021 MD&A, and Note 29 of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2021. PCL related to performing (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and impaired (Stage 3) financial assets, loan commitments, and financial guarantees is recorded within the respective segment. Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt income, including certain dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking’s results are reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the quarter was $41 million, compared with $34 million in the prior quarter and $37 million in the third quarter last year. Share of net income from investment in Schwab is reported in the U.S. Retail segment. Amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction are recorded in the Corporate segment.

Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.13%, an increase of 8 bps. Insurance claims and related expenses for the quarter increased $237 million, or 40%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of changes in the discount rate which resulted in a similar increase in fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income, higher current year claims, and more severe weather-related events. Non-interest expenses increased $25 million, or 1%, compared with the prior quarter reflecting higher spend supporting business growth, including employee related and technology expenses, partially offset by lower variable compensation.

Quarterly comparison – Q3 2022 vs. Q3 2021 U.S. Retail reported net income for the quarter was $1,442 million (US$1,122 million), an increase of $147 million (US$70 million), or 11% (7% in U.S. dollars) compared with the third quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, net income for the quarter was $1,464 million (US$1,139 million), an increase of $169 million (US$87 million), or 13% (8% in U.S. dollars). The reported and adjusted annualized ROE for the quarter were 14.8% and 15.0%, respectively, compared with 13.8% in the third quarter last year. U.S. Retail net income includes contributions from the U.S. Retail Bank and the Bank’s investment in Schwab. Reported net income for the quarter from the U.S. Retail Bank and the Bank’s investment in Schwab was $1,153 million (US$896 million) and $289 million (US$226 million), respectively. On an adjusted basis for the quarter, the U.S. Retail Bank’s net income was $1,175 million (US$913 million). The contribution from Schwab of US$226 million increased US$65 million, or 40%, primarily reflecting higher net interest income, partially offset by lower trading revenue. U.S. Retail Bank reported net income was US$896 million, an increase of US$5 million, or 1%, primarily reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher PCL and non-interest expenses including acquisition and integration-related charges for the First Horizon acquisition. U.S. Retail Bank adjusted net income was US$913 million, an increase of US$22 million, or 2%, primarily reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher PCL and non-interest expenses. U.S. Retail Bank revenue is derived from the personal and business banking and wealth management businesses. Revenue for the quarter was US$2,409 million, an increase of US$229 million, or 11%, compared with the third quarter last year. Net interest income of US$1,905 million, increased US$286 million, or 18%, largely driven by the benefit of higher deposit margins from the rising rate environment and higher business and personal deposit volumes, partially offset by lower income from PPP loan forgiveness and lower margin on loans.

Reported revenue for the quarter increased US$86 million, or 4%, compared with the prior quarter. Adjusted revenue for the quarter increased US$263 million, or 12%. Net interest income of US$1,905 million increased US$264 million, or 16%, primarily reflecting the benefit of higher deposit margins due to the rising interest rate environment and the effect of more days in the third quarter, partially offset by lower margin on loans. Net interest margin of 2.62% increased 41 bps quarter over quarter, as higher margin on deposits reflecting the rising interest rate environment and positive balance sheet mix was partially offset by lower PPP loan forgiveness and lower margin on loans. Reported non-interest income decreased US$178 million, or 26%, primarily reflecting a prior quarter insurance recovery related to litigation. Adjusted non-interest income of US$504 million was relatively flat compared with the prior quarter, reflecting fee income growth from increased customer activity, largely offset by lower valuation of certain investments. Average loan volumes increased US$4 billion, or 3%, compared with the prior quarter. Personal loans increased 3%, primarily reflecting growth in residential mortgage and auto originations, and higher credit card volumes. Business loans increased 2%, or 3% excluding PPP loans, primarily reflecting strong originations and new customer growth, higher commercial line utilization and increased customer activity.

Non-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss increased $2 billion reflecting new investments. Derivative assets increased $22 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income decreased $8 billion primarily reflecting maturities and sales, partially offset by new investments. Debt securities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses increased $61 billion reflecting new investments and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by maturities. Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements decreased $6 billion primarily reflecting a decrease in volume, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased $68 billion reflecting volume growth in business and government loans, real estate secured lending, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Investment in Schwab decreased $2 billion primarily reflecting the impact of the Bank’s share of Schwab’s other comprehensive loss. Other assets increased $3 billion primarily reflecting an increase in current income tax receivable, accounts receivable and other and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by a decrease in amounts receivable from brokers, dealers and clients reflecting lower volumes of pending trades. Total liabilities were $1,738 billion as at July 31, 2022, an increase of $109 billion, or 7%, from October 31, 2021. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the depreciation in the Canadian dollar increased total liabilities by $29 billion, or approximately 2%. The increase in total liabilities reflects deposits of $77 billion, financial liabilities designated at FVTPL of $26 billion, derivatives of $15 billion, and other liabilities of $12 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements of $17 billion and trading deposits of $4 billion. TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 22 Trading deposits decreased $4 billion primarily reflecting maturities. Derivative liabilities increased $15 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss increased $26 billion primarily reflecting new issuances and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by maturities. Deposits increased $77 billion reflecting volume growth in business and government deposits, personal deposits, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements decreased $17 billion reflecting a decrease in volume, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Other liabilities increased $12 billion primarily reflecting an increase in obligations related to securities sold short. Equity was $103 billion as at July 31, 2022, an increase of $3 billion from October 31, 2021. The increase in retained earnings and preferred shares and other equity instruments was offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income is primarily driven by losses in cash flow hedges and from the Bank’s share of the other comprehensive loss from investment in Schwab, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Quarterly comparison – Q3 2022 vs. Q3 2021 Gross impaired loans excluding acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans were $2,332 million as at July 31, 2022, a decrease of $319 million, or 12%, compared with the third quarter last year. Canadian Retail gross impaired loans decreased $190 million, or 18%, compared with the third quarter last year, reflecting improved credit conditions and largely recorded in the real estate secured lending and commercial lending portfolios. U.S. Retail gross impaired loans decreased $68 million, or 4%, compared with the third quarter last year, reflecting improved credit conditions and largely recorded in the commercial lending portfolios. Wholesale gross impaired loans decreased $61 million or 90%, compared with the third quarter last year, as there were no gross impaired loan formations in the Wholesale segment over the past year. Net impaired loans were $1,632 million as at July 31, 2022, a decrease of $306 million, or 16%, compared with the third quarter last year. The allowance for credit losses of $6,921 million as at July 31, 2022 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $707 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,340 million and Stage 1 allowance of $2,868 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $6 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses decreased $21 million, or 3%, reflecting resolutions in the Wholesale Banking segment. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses decreased $774 million, or 11%, reflecting releases in all segments, largely related to improved credit conditions. The allowance change included a decrease of $125 million attributable to the retailer program partners’ share of the U.S. strategic cards portfolio. The allowance for debt securities was $6 million, consistent with the third quarter last year. Forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables deemed to be predictive of expected credit losses (ECLs) based on the Bank’s experience, is used to determine ECL scenarios and associated probability weights to establish the probability-weighted ECLs. Each quarter, all base forecast macroeconomic variables are refreshed, resulting in new upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios. The probability weightings assigned to each ECL scenario are also reviewed each quarter and updated as required, as part of the Bank’s ECL governance process. As a result of periodic reviews and quarterly updates, the allowance for credit losses may be revised to reflect updates in loss estimates based on the Bank’s recent loss experience and its forward-looking views. The Bank periodically reviews the methodology and has performed certain additional qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s third quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on forward-looking information. The probability-weighted allowance for credit losses reflects the Bank’s forward-looking views. To the extent that certain anticipated effects cannot be fully incorporated into quantitative models, management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in determining the amount of ECLs. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and the allowance for credit losses will be updated in future quarters as additional information becomes available. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s third quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Bank calculates allowances for ECLs on debt securities measured at amortized cost and FVOCI. The Bank has $395 billion in such debt securities, all of which are performing (Stage 1 and 2) and none are impaired (Stage 3). The allowance for credit losses on DSAC and debt securities at FVOCI was $2 million and $4 million, respectively. Quarterly comparison – Q3 2022 vs. Q2 2022 Gross impaired loans excluding ACI loans decreased $65 million, or 3%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting resolutions outpacing formations in the Canadian and U.S. Retail segments. Impaired loans net of allowance decreased $63 million, or 4%, compared with the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses of $6,921 million as at July 31, 2022 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $707 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,340 million and Stage 1 allowance of $2,868 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $6 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses was $707 million, consistent with the prior quarter. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses increased $5 million, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting deterioration in the Bank’s macroeconomic forecasts, largely offset by the release of overlays previously set aside for economic uncertainty. The allowance for debt securities decreased by $1 million, compared to the prior quarter. For further details on loans, impaired loans, allowance for credit losses, and on the Bank’s use of forward-looking information and macroeconomic variables in determining its allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 6 of the Bank’s third quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Corporate Segment Losses**: The corporate segment reported a net loss of $752 million for Q3 2022, a significant increase from the $205 million loss in Q3 2021. This increase is primarily due to the mitigation of interest rate volatility related to the First Horizon acquisition, higher net corporate expenses, and lower revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities.\n\n2. **Adjusted Net Loss**: The adjusted net loss for Q3 2022 was $175 million, compared to $122 million in Q3 2021. The year-to-date adjusted net loss was $381 million, up from $322 million in the same period last year.\n\n3. **Revenue and Expenses**: Total revenue for Q3 2022 was $10.925 billion, with net interest income at $7.044 billion and non-interest income at $3.881 billion. Non-interest expenses increased to $6.096 billion.\n\n4. **Asset and Liability Growth**: Total assets increased by $112 billion (6%) from October 2021 to July 2022, driven by growth in loans, debt securities, and derivatives. Total liabilities grew by $109 billion (7%), primarily due to increased deposits and financial liabilities.\n\n5. **Credit Losses and Impaired Loans**: The allowance for credit losses was $6.921 billion, with a decrease in gross impaired loans by 12% year-over-year. The bank's forward-looking views and macroeconomic forecasts influence the allowance for expected credit losses.\n\n6. **Equity and Returns**: Total equity increased by $3 billion to $103 billion. The reported return on common equity was 13.5%, while the adjusted return was 16.1%.\n\nOverall, the report indicates challenges in the corporate segment due to acquisition-related expenses and interest rate volatility, alongside growth in assets and liabilities, and a focus on managing credit risks amid changing economic conditions."

Real Estate Secured Lending Retail real estate secured lending includes mortgages and lines of credit to North American consumers to satisfy financing needs including home purchases and refinancing. While the Bank retains first lien on the majority of properties held as security, there is a small portion of loans with second liens, but most of these are behind a TD mortgage that is in first position. In Canada, credit policies are designed so that the combined exposure of all uninsured facilities on one property does not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination. Lending at a higher loan-to-value ratio is permitted by legislation but requires default insurance. This insurance is contractual coverage for the life of eligible facilities and protects the Bank’s real estate secured lending portfolio against potential losses caused by borrowers’ default. The Bank may also purchase default insurance on lower loan-to-value ratio loans. The insurance is provided by either government-backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers. In the U.S., for residential mortgage originations, mortgage insurance is usually obtained from either government backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers when the loan-to-value exceeds 80% of the collateral value at origination. The Bank regularly performs stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio as part of its overall stress testing program. This is done with a view to determine the extent to which the portfolio would be vulnerable to a severe downturn in economic conditions. The effect of severe changes in house prices, interest rates, and unemployment levels are among the factors considered when assessing the impact on credit losses and the Bank’s overall profitability. A variety of portfolio segments, including dwelling type and geographical regions, are examined during the exercise to determine whether specific vulnerabilities exist.

Capital requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are commonly referred to as Basel III. Under Basel III, Total Capital consists of three components, namely CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III introduced a non-risk sensitive leverage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage exposure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. TD continues to manage its regulatory capital in accordance with the Basel III Capital Framework as discussed in the “Capital Position” section of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III OSFI’s Capital Adequacy Requirements guideline details how the Basel III capital rules apply to Canadian banks. Other requirements, in addition to those described in “OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III” section of Bank’s 2021 Annual Report, are noted below. On June 17, 2021, OSFI announced that the Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) would increase to 2.50% of total RWA, effective October 31, 2021, and this was reaffirmed on December 10, 2021 and on June 22, 2022. The Bank maintained its Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) status when the Financial Stability Board published the 2021 list of G-SIBs on November 23, 2021. As a result of the designation, the Bank continues to be subject to an additional loss absorbency requirement (CET1 as a percentage of RWA) of 1%. As the Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) surcharge is currently equivalent to the 1% G-SIB requirement, the Bank’s G-SIB designation has no additional impact on the Bank’s minimum CET1 regulatory requirements. On September 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guideline. Under this guideline, the Bank was required to meet a supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.0% of RWA, inclusive of the 2.50% DSB, and a TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75% by November 1, 2021. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio. The table below summarizes OSFI’s current regulatory minimum capital and TLAC ratios for the Bank. Minimum Capital Conservation Buffer D-SIB / G-SIB Surcharge 1 Pillar 1 Regulatory target 2 DSB 3 Pillar 1 & 2 regulatory target CET1 4.5 % 2.5 % 1.0 % 8.0 % 2.5 % 10.5 % Tier 1 6.0 2.5 1.0 9.5 2.5 12.0 Total Capital 8.0 2.5 1.0 11.5 2.5 14.0 TLAC 18.0 2.5 1.0 21.5 2.5 24.0 1 The higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharge applies. The D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the Bank’s 1% G-SIB additional common equity requirement. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%. 2 The Bank’s countercyclical buffer requirement is 0% as of July 31, 2022. 3 The DSB increased to 2.5%, from 1.0%, of total RWA effective October 31, 2021. The Bank’s Leverage Ratio is calculated as per OSFI’s Leverage Requirements guideline and has a regulatory minimum requirement of 3%. As noted above, the Bank is required to meet a supervisory TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75%.",
        "summary": "The text provides a detailed overview of TD Bank Group's sovereign risk and regulatory capital requirements as of the third quarter of 2022. It includes a breakdown of the bank's direct credit exposures outside Canada and the U.S., highlighting significant exposure in Europe, the United Kingdom, Asia, and other regions, with a total net exposure of CAD 112.3 billion as of July 31, 2022. The report also discusses the bank's adherence to Basel III capital requirements, including the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios, as well as the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guidelines. The bank maintains its Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) status, which requires an additional 1% CET1 as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. The Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) increased to 2.5% of total RWA, impacting the TLAC target ratio. The bank's leverage ratio requirement is 3%, with a TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75%."

        "chunk": "- TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 26 Effective January 1, 2013, all newly issued non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments must include non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) provisions to qualify as regulatory capital. NVCC provisions require the conversion of non-common capital instruments into a variable number of common shares of the Bank upon the occurrence of a trigger event. A trigger event is defined as an event where OSFI determines that the Bank is, or is about to become, non-viable and that after conversion of all non-common capital instruments, the viability of the Bank is expected to be restored, or if the Bank has accepted or agreed to accept a capital injection or equivalent support from a federal or provincial government of Canada without which the Bank would have been determined by OSFI to be non viable. Non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments issued prior to January 1, 2013, which did not include NVCC provisions were non-qualifying capital instruments and subject to a phase-out period which began in 2013 and ended on November 1, 2021. In fiscal 2020, OSFI introduced a number of measures to support D-SIBs’ ability to supply credit to the economy during an expected period of disruption related to COVID-19 and market conditions. These measures, and subsequent guidance issued by OSFI, are described in the “OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III” section of Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. The ‘Total exposures as defined for use in the Basel III leverage ratio’ G-SIB indicator for October 31, 2021 previously disclosed in the first quarter of 2022 has been subsequently revised. The G-SIB indicators including the revision are presented in the table below. TABLE 24: G-SIB INDICATORS 1, 2 1 The G-SIB indicators are prepared based on the methodology prescribed in BCBS guidelines published and disclosed in accordance with OSFI’s Advisory on G-SIBs – Public Disclosure Requirements. Given the Bank was designated as a G-SIB by the FSB on November 22, 2019, additional public disclosures on these indicators are required. Refer to the Bank’s Regulatory Capital Disclosures at www.td.com/investor-relations/ir-homepage/regulatory-disclosures/g-sib/disclosures.jsp for these additional disclosures on the 2021 G-SIB indicators. In the event that one or both regulators provide comments to the Bank regarding its submission that would result in changes to the G-SIB indicators listed in the table above, the Bank will publish such revised G-SIB indicators on its website. 2 The Intra-financial system asset indicator for October 31, 2020 has been revised.

The decrease was partially offset by organic capital growth, the issuance of common shares pursuant to the Bank’s dividend reinvestment plan, and a decrease in the threshold deduction for non-significant investment in financial entities. As at July 31, 2022, the Bank’s Leverage and TLAC Leverage ratios were 4.3% and 8.5%, respectively. The decrease in the Bank’s Leverage ratio from 4.8% as at October 31, 2021 primarily reflects the expiration of the exclusion of sovereign-issued securities from the leverage ratio measure on December 31, 2021, and organic leverage growth, partially offset by organic capital growth. Future regulatory capital developments, in addition to those described in the “Future Regulatory Capital Developments” section of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report, are noted below. On January 31, 2022, OSFI announced revised capital, leverage, liquidity and disclosure rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. The Leverage Requirements Guideline revisions include a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the regulatory minimum requirement of 3.0%. This buffer will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio supervisory target of 6.75%. The revised rules are effective in the second quarter of 2023, with the exception of those related to market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk which are effective in 2024. On June 28, 2022, OSFI released an Advisory (Clarification on the Treatment of Innovative Real Estate Secured Lending Products under Guideline B-20), which will result in mortgage loans which do not meet OSFI Guideline B-20 expectations to be treated as investor mortgages under Basel III reforms and attract higher risk weights.

Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on common shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion, or from the open market at market price. The Bank had determined that, beginning with the dividend approved on May 25, 2022 for the quarter ending July 31, 2022, and until further announcement, the Bank will issue the common shares from treasury and will apply a 2% discount to the average market price of such common shares. During the three months ended July 31, 2022, the Bank issued 7.5 million common shares from treasury with a 2% discount. During the nine months ended July 31, 2022, the Bank issued 2.5 million common shares from treasury with no discount and 7.5 million common shares with a 2% discount. During the three and nine months ended July 31, 2021, the Bank issued 1.2 million and 3.9 million common shares, respectively, from treasury with no discount. On January 7, 2022, the Bank announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange and OSFI had approved the Bank’s previously announced normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to repurchase for cancellation up to 50 million of its common shares. Concurrent with the announcement of the Bank’s acquisition of First Horizon on February 28, 2022, the Bank’s automatic share purchase plan established under its NCIB automatically terminated pursuant to its terms. During the six months ended April 30, 2022, the Bank repurchased 21 million common shares under the NCIB, at an average price of $104.50 per share, for a total amount of $2.2 billion, which represents a $1.9 billion premium over the share capital amount. No common shares were repurchased during the three months ended July 31, 2022. All series of preferred shares – Class A include NVCC provisions. If a NVCC trigger event were to occur and excluding the Preferred Shares Series 26 issued with respect to LRCNs, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the respective series of preferred shares at the time of conversion, would be 1.1 billion in aggregate. The LRCNs, by virtue of the recourse to the Preferred Shares Series 26, include NVCC provisions. For LRCNs, if a NVCC trigger were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Shares Series 26, would be 350 million. For NVCC subordinated notes and debentures, if a NVCC trigger event were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there is no accrued and unpaid interest on the respective subordinated notes and debentures, would be 3.2 billion in aggregate. In addition to the risks described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the Bank’s 2021 MD&A, there are numerous other risk factors, many of which are beyond the Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, that could cause the Bank’s results to differ significantly from its plans, objectives, and estimates or could impact the Bank’s reputation or sustainability of its business model. All forward-looking statements, including those in this MD&A, are, by their very nature, subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific, which may cause the Bank’s actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Some of these factors are discussed in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A and in this “Risk Factors and Management” section of this document, and others are noted in the “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section of this document. For a discussion of risk factors that could adversely affect the Bank’s financial results and condition, refer to the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A. The following risk factor supplements the “Impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic” risk factor described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A. Impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of additional variants that are potentially more contagious and/or more vaccine-resistant than current or past COVID-19 variants, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased levels of workforce absenteeism and disruption for the Bank and for its suppliers and other third parties upon which the Bank relies, which may increase operational and compliance risks for the Bank. Increased absenteeism and disruption may also increase the Bank’s exposure to the other risks described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A, including those set out in the “Impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic” risk factor. The following risk factor amends the ‘Ability to Attract, Develop, and Retain key Talent’ risk factor described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A. Ability to Attract, Develop, and Retain Key Talent The Bank’s future performance is dependent on the availability of qualified talent and the Bank’s ability to attract, develop, and retain key talent. The Bank’s management understands that the competition for talent continues to increase across geographies, industries, and emerging capabilities across a number of sectors including financial services. This competition has intensified and is expected to continue to intensify as a result of the impact of COVID-19, including as a result of remote work opportunities and relaxing geographic boundaries. This could result in increased attrition across organizations particularly in areas where core professional and specialized skills are required. Annually, the Bank undertakes a talent review process to assess critical capability requirements for all areas of the business. Through this process, an assessment of current executive leadership, technical and core capabilities, as well as talent development opportunities is completed against both near term and future business needs. The outcomes from the process inform plans at both the enterprise and business level to retain, develop, or acquire the talent which are then actioned throughout the course of the year. Although it is the goal of the Bank’s management resource policies and practices to attract, develop, and retain key talent employed by the Bank or an entity acquired by the Bank, the Bank may not be able to do so. The Bank continues to rely on the Bank’s annual talent review program as well as the Bank’s regular, effective management practices to proactively assess and address retention and recruitment risk and emphasize ongoing communication with talent to ensure appropriate responses on a case-by-case basis.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial and operational activities. The bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan allowing shareholders to purchase additional common shares, with recent issuances from treasury at a 2% discount. The bank repurchased 21 million common shares under a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) before halting due to the acquisition of First Horizon. The report also discusses the potential issuance of common shares under NVCC provisions in case of a trigger event. Additionally, the bank addresses various risk factors, including the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may increase operational risks and affect workforce availability. The bank emphasizes the importance of attracting and retaining key talent, noting intensified competition due to remote work trends. It conducts an annual talent review to align its workforce with business needs, though challenges in talent retention and acquisition remain."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 30 Growing profitability in financial results based on balanced revenue, expense and capital growth services involves selectively taking and managing risks within the Bank’s risk appetite. The Bank’s goal is to earn a stable and sustainable rate of return for every dollar of risk it takes, while putting significant emphasis on investing in its businesses to meet its future strategic objectives. The Bank’s businesses and operations are exposed to a broad number of risks that have been identified and defined in the Enterprise Risk Framework. The Bank’s tolerance to those risks is defined in the Enterprise Risk Appetite which has been developed within a comprehensive framework that takes into consideration current conditions in which the Bank operates and the impact that emerging risks will have on TD’s strategy and risk profile. The Bank’s risk appetite states that it takes risks required to build its business, but only if those risks: (1) fit the business strategy and can be understood and managed; (2) do not expose the enterprise to any significant single loss events; TD does not ‘bet the bank’ on any single acquisition, business, or product; and (3) do not risk harming the TD brand. Each business is responsible for setting and aligning its individual risk appetites with that of the enterprise based on a thorough examination of the specific risks to which it is exposed. The Bank considers it critical to regularly assess its operating environment and highlight top and emerging risks. These are risks with a potential to have a material effect on the Bank and where the attention of senior leaders is focused due to the potential magnitude or immediacy of their impact. Risks are identified, discussed, and actioned by senior leaders and reported quarterly to the Risk Committee. Specific plans to mitigate top and emerging risks are prepared, monitored, and adjusted as required. The Bank’s risk governance structure and risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. Additional information on risk factors can be found in this document and the 2021 MD&A under the heading “Risk Factors and Management”. For a complete discussion of the risk governance structure and the risk management approach, refer to the “Managing Risk” section in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. The shaded sections of this MD&A represent a discussion relating to market and liquidity risks and form an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended July 31, 2022. Gross credit risk exposure, also referred to as exposure at default (EAD), is the total amount the Bank is exposed to at the time of default of a loan and is measured before counterparty-specific provisions or write-offs. Gross credit risk exposure does not reflect the effects of credit risk mitigation (CRM) and includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. On-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of outstanding loans, acceptances, non-trading securities, derivatives, and certain other repo-style transactions. Off-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of undrawn commitments, guarantees, and certain other repo-style transactions. Gross credit risk exposures for the two approaches the Bank uses to measure credit risk are included in the following table.

        "chunk": "D BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 32 Calculating VaR The Bank computes total VaR on a daily basis by combining the General Market Risk (GMR) and Idiosyncratic Debt Specific Risk (IDSR) associated with the Bank’s trading positions. GMR is determined by creating a distribution of potential changes in the market value of the current portfolio using historical simulation. The Bank values the current portfolio using the market price and rate changes of the most recent 259 trading days for equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity products. GMR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. A one-day holding period is used for GMR calculation, which is scaled up to ten days for regulatory capital calculation purposes. IDSR measures idiosyncratic (single-name) credit spread risk for credit exposures in the trading portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. The IDSR model is based on the historical behaviour of five-year idiosyncratic credit spreads. Similar to GMR, IDSR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. IDSR is measured for a ten-day holding period. The following graph discloses daily one-day VaR usage and trading net revenue, reported on a taxable equivalent basis, within Wholesale Banking. Trading net revenue includes trading income and net interest income related to positions within the Bank’s market risk capital trading books. For the quarter ended July 31, 2022, there were 11 days of trading losses and trading net revenue was positive for 83% of the trading days, reflecting normal trading activity. Losses in the quarter did not exceed VaR on any trading day.

The Bank continuously improves its VaR methodologies and incorporates new risk measures in line with market conventions, industry best practices, and regulatory requirements. To mitigate some of the shortcomings of VaR, the Bank uses additional metrics designed for risk management and capital purposes. These include Stressed VaR, IRC, Stress Testing Framework, as well as limits based on the sensitivity to various market risk factors. Calculating Stressed VaR In addition to VaR, the Bank also calculates Stressed VaR, which includes Stressed GMR and Stressed IDSR. Stressed VaR is designed to measure the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of stressed market conditions. Stressed VaR is determined using similar techniques and assumptions in GMR and IDSR VaR. However, instead of using the most recent 259 trading days (one year), the Bank uses a selected year of stressed market conditions. In the third quarter of 2022, Stressed VaR was calculated using the one-year period that includes the 2008 financial crisis. The appropriate historical one-year period to use for Stressed VaR is determined on a quarterly basis. Stressed VaR is a part of regulatory capital requirements. Calculating the Incremental Risk Charge The IRC is applied to all instruments in the trading book subject to migration and default risk. Migration risk represents the risk of changes in the credit ratings of the Bank’s exposures. TD applies a Monte Carlo simulation with a one-year horizon and a 99.9% confidence level to determine IRC, which is consistent with regulatory requirements. IRC is based on a “constant level of risk” assumption, which requires banks to assign a liquidity horizon to positions that are subject to IRC. IRC is a part of regulatory capital requirements.",

The report notes that trading net revenue was positive for 83% of the days in the third quarter of 2022, with no losses exceeding VaR.

It is not meaningful to compute a diversification effect because the high and low may occur on different days for different risk types. Average VaR increased both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year due to widening of credit spreads, market volatility and changes in bond positions. Average Stressed VaR increased compared to same quarter last year due to widening of credit spreads as well as changes in bond positions. Average IRC decreased both compared to last quarter and same quarter last year due to changes in bond positions across certain sectors. Validation of VaR Model The Bank uses a back-testing process to compare the actual and theoretical profit and losses to VaR to ensure that they are consistent with the statistical results of the VaR model. The theoretical profit or loss is generated using the daily price movements on the assumption that there is no change in the composition of the portfolio. Validation of the IRC model must follow a different approach since the one-year horizon and 99.9% confidence level preclude standard back-testing techniques. Instead, key parameters of the IRC model such as transition and correlation matrices are subject to independent validation by benchmarking against external study results or through analysis using internal or external data. Structural (Non-Trading) Interest Rate Risk The Bank’s structural interest rate risk arises from traditional personal and commercial banking activity and is generally the result of mismatches between the maturities and repricing dates of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. The measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book does not include exposures from TD’s Wholesale Banking or Insurance businesses. The primary measures for this risk are Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS). The EVE Sensitivity measures the impact of a specified interest rate shock to the change in the net present value of the Bank’s banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items. It reflects a measurement of the potential present value impact on shareholders’ equity without an assumed term profile for the management of the Bank’s own equity and excludes product margins. The NIIS measures the NII change over a twelve-month horizon for a specified change in interest rates for banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off balance sheet items assuming a constant balance sheet over the period. The Bank’s Market Risk policy sets overall limits on the structural interest rate risk measures. These limits are periodically reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee. In addition to the Board policy limits, book-level risk limits are set for the Bank’s management of non-trading interest rate risk by Risk Management. Exposures against these limits are routinely monitored and reported, and breaches of the Board limits, if any, are escalated to both the Asset/Liability and Capital Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee. The following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rates on the EVE and NIIS measures. Interest rate floors are applied by currency to the decrease in rates such that they do not exceed expected lower bounds, with the most material currencies set to a floor of -25 bps.

Including these has no impact to the quarter-over-quarter results as these were existing hedges which economically hedge the Bank’s non-trading market risk and as such continue to be included in these measures. As at July 31, 2022, an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase in interest rates would have had a negative impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,329 million, an increase of $36 million from last quarter, and a positive impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,291 million, a decrease of $254 million from last quarter. An immediate and sustained 100 bps decrease in interest rates would have had a positive impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,140 million, a decrease of $9 million from last quarter, and a negative impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,431 million, a decrease of $143 million from last quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in up shock EVE is primarily due to a small increase in rate sensitivity in the Canadian region. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in down shock NII Sensitivity is primarily due to rising deposit betas and changes in deposit composition, partially offset by an increase in the effective shock given the increased level of rates and the measurement using a -25 bps floor.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report highlights several key insights regarding its portfolio market risk measures and structural interest rate risk. The average Value-at-Risk (VaR) increased both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by widening credit spreads, market volatility, and changes in bond positions. The Stressed VaR also rose compared to the same quarter last year due to similar factors. However, the Incremental Risk Capital Charge (IRC) decreased due to changes in bond positions across certain sectors.\n\nThe bank employs a back-testing process to validate its VaR model, while the IRC model is validated through benchmarking against external studies. Structural interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the maturities and repricing dates of assets and liabilities, with primary measures being Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS).\n\nAs of July 31, 2022, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would negatively impact the bank's EVE by $1,329 million but positively impact NII by $1,291 million. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease would positively impact EVE by $1,140 million but negatively impact NII by $1,431 million. Changes in these sensitivities are attributed to rate sensitivity adjustments in Canada and changes in deposit composition and betas."

Financial obligations can arise from deposit withdrawals, debt maturities, commitments to provide credit or liquidity support, or the need to pledge additional collateral. TD’S LIQUIDITY RISK APPETITE The Bank maintains a prudent and disciplined approach to managing its potential exposure to liquidity risk. The Bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under a combined bank-specific and market-wide stress scenario, and a minimum buffer over regulatory requirements prescribed by OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) guidelines. Under the LAR guidelines, Canadian banks are required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at the minimum of 100% other than during periods of financial stress and to maintain a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at the minimum of 100%. The Bank’s funding program emphasizes maximizing deposits as a core source of funding and having ready access to wholesale funding markets across diversified terms, funding types, and currencies that is designed to ensure low exposure to a sudden contraction of wholesale funding capacity and to minimize structural liquidity gaps. The Bank also maintains a contingency funding plan to enhance preparedness for recovery from potential liquidity stress events. The Bank’s strategies and actions comprise an integrated liquidity risk management program that is designed to ensure low exposure to liquidity risk and compliance with regulatory requirements. The Bank’s ALCO oversees the Bank’s liquidity risk management program. It ensures there are effective management structures and practices in place to properly measure and manage liquidity risk. The Global Liquidity & Funding Committee, a subcommittee of the ALCO comprised of senior management from Treasury and Balance Sheet Management (TBSM), Risk Management and Wholesale Banking, identifies and monitors the Bank’s liquidity risks. The management of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the SET member responsible for TBSM, while oversight and challenge is provided by the ALCO and independently by Risk Management. The Risk Committee regularly reviews the Bank’s liquidity position and approves the Bank’s Liquidity Risk Management Framework bi-annually and the related policies annually. The Bank has established TD Group US Holding LLC (TDGUS) as TD’s U.S. Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), as well as a Combined U.S. Operations (CUSO) reporting unit that consists of the IHC and TD’s U.S. branch and agency network. Both TDGUS and CUSO are managed to the U.S. Enhanced Prudential Standards liquidity requirements in addition to the Bank’s liquidity management framework. The Bank’s liquidity risk appetite and liquidity risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report.

Liquid assets The unencumbered liquid assets the Bank holds to meet its liquidity requirements must be high-quality securities that the Bank believes can be monetized quickly in stress conditions with minimum loss in market value. The liquidity value of unencumbered liquid assets considers estimated market or trading depths, settlement timing, and/or other identified impediments to potential sale or pledging. Overall, the Bank expects any reduction in market value of its liquid asset portfolio to be modest given the underlying high credit quality and demonstrated liquidity. Assets held by the Bank to meet liquidity requirements are summarized in the following tables. The tables do not include assets held within the Bank’s insurance businesses as these are used to support insurance-specific liabilities and capital requirements.

Where a particular asset has been encumbered and TD has holdings of the asset both on-balance sheet and off balance sheet, for the purpose of this disclosure, the on- and off-balance sheet holdings are encumbered in alignment with the business practice. 2 Assets received as collateral through off-balance transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, margin loans, and other client activity. 3 Represents assets that have been posted externally to support the Bank’s day-to-day operations, including securities financing transactions, clearing and payments, and derivative transactions. Also includes assets that have been pledged supporting Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) activity. 4 Assets supporting TD’s long-term funding activities, assets pledged against securitization liabilities, and assets held by consolidated securitization vehicles or in pools for covered bond issuance. 5 Assets that are considered readily available in their current legal form to generate funding or support collateral needs. This category includes reported FHLB assets that remain unutilized and DSAC that are available for collateral purposes however not regularly utilized in practice. 6 Assets that cannot be used to support funding or collateral requirements in their current form. This category includes those assets that are potentially eligible as funding program collateral or for pledging to central banks (for example, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation insured mortgages that can be securitized into NHA MBS). 7 Includes trading loans, securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL and other financial assets designated at FVTPL, financial assets at FVOCI, and DSAC. 8 Assets reported in the “Bank-owned assets” column represent the value of the loans extended and not the value of the collateral received. The loan value from the reverse repurchase transactions is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double-counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 9 The loan value from the margin loans/client activity is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 10 Other assets include investment in Schwab, goodwill, other intangibles, land, buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets, deferred tax assets, amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, and other assets on the balance sheet not reported in the above categories. In addition to the Severe Combined Stress Scenario, the Bank performs liquidity stress testing on multiple alternate scenarios. These scenarios are a mix of TD specific events and market-wide stress events designed to test the impact from risk factors material to the Bank’s risk profile. Liquidity assessments are also part of the Bank’s Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing program. The Bank has liquidity contingency funding plans (CFP) in place at the overall Bank level and for subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions (“Regional CFPs”). The Bank’s CFP provides a documented framework for managing unexpected liquidity situations and thus is an integral component of the Bank’s overall liquidity risk management program. It outlines different contingency levels based on the severity and duration of the liquidity situation and identifies recovery actions appropriate for each level. For each recovery action, it provides key operational steps required to execute the action. Regional CFPs identify recovery actions to address region-specific stress events. The actions and governance structure outlined in the Bank’s CFP are aligned with the Bank’s Crisis Management Recovery Plan. Credit ratings impact the Bank’s borrowing costs and ability to raise funds. Rating downgrades could potentially result in higher financing costs, increased requirements to pledge collateral, reduced access to capital markets, and could also affect the Bank’s ability to enter into derivative transactions. Credit ratings and outlooks provided by rating agencies reflect their views and are subject to change from time-to-time, based on a number of factors including the Bank’s financial strength, competitive position, and liquidity, as well as factors not entirely within the Bank’s control, including the methodologies used by rating agencies and conditions affecting the overall financial services industry.",

With respect to outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, TD has no contractual obligation to buy back these outstanding TD debt securities, and as a result, a 0% outflow rate is applied under the OSFI LAR guideline. 8 Total HQLA includes both asset haircuts and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (HQLA assets after haircuts are capped at 40% for Level 2 and 15% for Level 2B). 9 Total Net Cash Outflows include both inflow and outflow rates and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (inflows are capped at 75% of outflows). The Bank’s average LCR of 121% for the quarter ended July 31, 2022 continues to meet the regulatory requirements. The Bank holds a variety of liquid assets commensurate with liquidity needs of the organization. Many of these assets qualify as HQLA under the OSFI LAR guideline. The average HQLA of the Bank for the quarter ended July 31, 2022 was $333 billion (April 30, 2022 – $323 billion), with Level 1 assets representing 84% (April 30, 2022 – 85%). The Bank’s reported HQLA excludes excess HQLA from the U.S. Retail operations, as required by the OSFI LAR guideline, to reflect liquidity transfer considerations between U.S. Retail and its affiliates as a result of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s regulations. By excluding excess HQLA, the U.S. Retail LCR is effectively capped at 100% prior to total Bank consolidation. As described in the “How TD Manages Liquidity Risk” section of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report, the Bank manages its HQLA and other liquidity buffers to the higher of TD’s 90-day surplus requirement and the target buffers over regulatory requirements from the LCR, NSFR, and the Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) metrics. As a result, the total stock of HQLA is subject to ongoing rebalancing against the projected liquidity requirements. The NSFR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of total available stable funding (ASF) over total required stable funding (RSF) in accordance with OSFI’s LAR guideline. The Bank must maintain an NSFR ratio equal to or above 100% in accordance with the LAR guideline. The Bank’s ASF comprises the Bank’s liability and capital instruments (including but not limited to deposits and wholesale funding). The Bank’s RSF comprises the Bank’s assets and off-balance sheet activities and is a function of the liquidity characteristics and maturity profile of these assets.

These may include, but are not limited to, items such as capital with perpetual maturity, non-maturity deposits, short positions, open maturity positions, non-HQLA equities, and physical traded commodities. 2 Weighted values are calculated after the application of respective NSFR weights, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline. 3 As defined by the OSFI LAR guideline, stable deposits from retail and SME customers are deposits that are insured and are either held in transactional accounts or the depositors have an established relationship with the Bank that makes deposit withdrawals highly unlikely. 4 Operational deposits from non-SME business customers are deposits kept with the Bank in order to facilitate their access and ability to conduct payment and settlement activities. These activities include clearing, custody, or cash management services. 5 Interdependent asset and liability items are deemed by OSFI to be interdependent and have RSF and ASF risk factors adjusted to zero. Interdependent liabilities cannot fall due while asset is still on balance sheet, cannot be used to fund any other assets and principal payments from the asset cannot be used for anything other than repaying the liability. As such, the only interdependent assets and liabilities that qualify for this treatment at the Bank are the liabilities arising from the Canada Mortgage Bonds Program and their corresponding encumbered assets. 6 Includes Residential Mortgages and HELOCs. The Bank’s NSFR for the quarter ended July 31, 2022 is at 123% (October 31, 2021 – 125%) and has met the regulatory requirements. The NSFR changes quarter-to-quarter are based on a number of factors including deposit and loan growth, changes in capital levels, wholesale funding issuance and maturities, and changes in the maturity profile of wholesale funding. TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 41 The Bank has access to a variety of unsecured and secured funding sources. The Bank’s funding activities are conducted in accordance with the liquidity management policy that requires assets be funded to the appropriate term and to a prudent diversification profile. The Bank’s primary approach to managing funding activities is to maximize the use of deposits raised through personal and commercial banking channels. The following table illustrates the Bank’s large base of personal and commercial, wealth, and Schwab sweep deposits (collectively, “P&C deposits”) that make up over 70% of the Bank’s total funding. TABLE 40: SUMMARY OF DEPOSIT FUNDING (millions of Canadian dollars) As at July 31 2022 October 31 2021 P&C deposits – Canadian Retail $ 522,299 $ 519,466 P&C deposits – U.S. Retail 1 490,147 472,742 Total $ 1,012,446 $ 992,208 1 P&C deposits in U.S. Retail are presented on a CAD equivalent basis and therefore period-over-period movements reflect both underlying growth and changes in the foreign exchange rate. The Bank maintains various registered external wholesale term (greater than 1 year) funding programs to provide access to diversified funding sources, including asset securitization, covered bonds, and unsecured wholesale debt. The Bank raises term funding through Senior Notes, NHA MBS, and notes backed by credit card receivables (Evergreen Credit Card Trust) and home equity lines of credit (Genesis Trust II). The Bank’s wholesale funding is diversified by geography, by currency, and by funding types. The Bank raises short-term (1 year and less) funding using certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and bankers’ acceptances. The following table summarizes the registered term funding and capital programs by geography, with the related program size as at July 31, 2022. Canada Capital Securities Program ($15 billion) Canadian Senior Medium-Term Linked Notes Program ($4 billion) HELOC ABS Program (Genesis Trust II) ($7 billion) United States U.S. SEC (F-3) Registered Capital and Debt Program (US$75 billion) Europe United Kingdom Listing Authority (UKLA) Registered Legislative Covered Bond Program ($80 billion) UKLA Registered European Medium-Term Note Program (US$20 billion) The following table presents a breakdown of the Bank’s term debt by currency and funding type. Term funding as at July 31, 2022, was $134.9 billion (October 31, 2021 – $100.7 billion). Note that Table 41: Long-Term Funding and Table 42: Wholesale Funding do not include any funding accessed via repurchase transactions or securities financing.

The Bank maintains depositor concentration limits in respect of short-term wholesale deposits so that it is not overly reliant on individual depositors for funding. The Bank further limits short-term wholesale funding maturity concentration in an effort to mitigate refinancing risk during a stress event. - TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 42 The following table represents the remaining maturity of various sources of funding outstanding as at July 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021.

Excludes $1.7 billion of structured notes subject to conversion under the “bail-in” regime (October 31, 2021 – $1.4 billion). 6 Subordinated notes and debentures are not considered wholesale funding as they may be raised primarily for capital management purposes. 7 Includes fixed-term deposits from non-bank institutions (unsecured) of $19.9 billion (October 31, 2021 – $14.6 billion) and the remaining are non-term deposits. Excluding the Wholesale Banking residential mortgage trading business, the Bank’s total mortgage-backed securities issued to external investors for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022 was $0.5 billion and $1.4 billion (three and nine months ended July 31, 2021 – $0.4 billion and $1.4 billion) and other asset backed securities issued for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022 was nil (three and nine months ended July 31, 2021 – nil). The Bank also issued $11.3 billion and $33.4 billion of unsecured medium-term notes for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022 (three and nine months ended July 31, 2021 – $3.7 billion and $13.7 billion) and $8.0 billion and $15.4 billion of covered bonds for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022 (three and nine months ended July 31, 2021 – nil). In January 2022, OSFI published finalized updates to its LAR guideline, following a public consultation period that began in March 2021. The primary changes to the LAR involve enhancements to the NCCF supervisory tool to improve the risk sensitivity to the metric. Significant changes include the addition of contingencies for undrawn loan commitments, changes to certain loan cash inflows, and the adjustment of deposit runoff factors. The effective date of the changes will be April 2023. In January 2022, OSFI published an updated Pillar 3 Disclosure Guideline, which covers liquidity disclosures among other topics. The guideline provides OSFI’s updated expectations for the domestic implementation of Basel’s Pillar 3 Framework. The guideline will not materially impact the Bank’s existing liquidity disclosures, but will contribute to improved consistency and comparability of disclosures across jurisdictions. The effective date of the changes will be in the second quarter of 2023. MATURITY ANALYSIS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet categories by remaining contractual maturity. Off-balance sheet commitments include contractual obligations to make future payments on certain lease-related commitments, certain purchase obligations, and other liabilities. The values of credit instruments reported in the following table represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the Bank could be obligated to extend should such instruments be fully drawn or utilized. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contractual amounts is not representative of expected future liquidity requirements. These contractual obligations have an impact on the Bank’s short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The maturity analysis presented does not depict the degree of the Bank’s maturity transformation or the Bank’s exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk. The Bank ensures that assets are appropriately funded to protect against borrowing cost volatility and potential reductions to funding market availability. The Bank utilizes stable non-maturity deposits (chequing and savings accounts) and term deposits as the primary source of long-term funding for the Bank’s non-trading assets including personal and business term loans and the stable balance of revolving lines of credit. Additionally, the Bank issues long-term funding in respect of such non-trading assets and raises short term funding primarily to finance trading assets. The liquidity of trading assets under stressed market conditions is considered when determining the appropriate term of the funding.

        "summary": "The financial text provides a detailed analysis of TD Bank Group's liquidity and funding status for the third quarter of 2022. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):** TD Bank's average LCR for the quarter ended July 31, 2022, was 121%, indicating a strong liquidity position that meets regulatory requirements. The bank's high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) averaged $333 billion, with Level 1 assets comprising 84%.\n\n2. **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR):** The NSFR was 123% as of July 31, 2022, also meeting regulatory standards. This ratio reflects the bank's ability to fund its activities with stable sources over a one-year horizon.\n\n3. **Funding Sources:** The bank relies heavily on personal and commercial deposits, which make up over 70% of its total funding. It also utilizes various wholesale funding programs, including asset securitization and covered bonds, diversified by geography and currency.\n\n4. **Term Funding:** As of July 31, 2022, TD Bank's term funding was $134.9 billion, with a significant portion in senior unsecured medium-term notes and covered bonds.\n\n5. **Regulatory Updates:** The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) has updated its Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) guideline, effective April 2023, to enhance risk sensitivity. These changes will not materially impact TD Bank's existing liquidity disclosures.\n\nOverall, TD Bank maintains a robust liquidity and funding position, supported by a diversified funding strategy and compliance with regulatory requirements."

        "chunk": "- TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 45 SECURITIZATION AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Bank enters into securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations. The Bank is involved with structured entities (SEs) that it sponsors, as well as entities sponsored by third parties. Refer to “Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section, Note 9: Transfers of Financial Assets and Note 10: Structured Entities of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report and “Transfers of Financial Assets Qualifying for Derecognition” section of Note 6 of the Bank’s third quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended July 31, 2022. Securitization of Bank-Originated Assets The Bank securitizes residential mortgages, personal loans, credit cards and business and government loans to enhance its liquidity position, to diversify sources of funding, and to optimize the management of the balance sheet. Residential Mortgage Loans The Bank securitizes residential mortgage loans through significant consolidated and unconsolidated SEs and Canadian non-SE third parties. Residential mortgage loans securitized by the Bank may give rise to full derecognition of the financial assets depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In instances where the Bank fully derecognizes residential mortgage loans, the Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through retained interests. Consumer Instalment and Other Personal Loans The Bank securitizes consumer instalment and other personal loans through a consolidated SE. The Bank consolidates the SE as it serves as a financing vehicle for the Bank’s assets, the Bank has power over the key economic decisions of the SE, and the Bank is exposed to the majority of the residual risks of the SE. Credit Card Loans The Bank securitizes credit card loans through an SE. The Bank consolidates the SE as it serves as a financing vehicle for the Bank’s assets, the Bank has power over the key economic decisions of the SE, and the Bank is exposed to the majority of the residual risks of the SE. Business and Government Loans The Bank securitizes business and government loans through significant unconsolidated SEs and Canadian non-SE third parties. Business and government loans securitized by the Bank may be derecognized from the Bank’s balance sheet depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In instances where the Bank fully derecognizes business and government loans, the Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through retained interests. There are no ECLs on the retained interests of the securitized business and government loans as the mortgages are all government insured. Securitization of Third Party-Originated Assets Significant Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities The Bank securitizes third party-originated assets through Bank-sponsored SEs, including its Canadian multi-seller conduits which are not consolidated. These Canadian multi-seller conduits securitize Canadian originated third-party assets. The Bank administers these multi-seller conduits and provides liquidity facilities as well as securities distribution services; it may also provide credit enhancements. TD’s maximum potential exposure to loss due to its ownership interest in commercial paper and through the provision of liquidity facilities for multi-seller conduits was $10.6 billion as at July 31, 2022 (October 31, 2021 – $10.5 billion). In addition, as at July 31, 2022, the Bank had committed to provide $3.2 billion in liquidity facilities that can be used to support future asset-backed commercial paper in the purchase of deal-specific assets (October 31, 2021 – $2.1 billion). Off-Balance Sheet Exposure to Third Party-Sponsored Conduits The Bank has off-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits arising from providing liquidity facilities and funding commitments of $3.0 billion as at July 31, 2022 (October 31, 2021 – $2.5 billion). The assets within these conduits are comprised of individual notes backed by automotive loan receivables, credit card receivables, equipment receivables and trade receivables. On-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits have been included in the financial statements. The Bank’s unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. For details of the Bank’s accounting policies under IFRS, refer to Note 2 of the Bank’s third quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. For details of the Bank’s significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions under IFRS, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s third quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no new accounting policies that have been adopted by the Bank for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022. ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Effective December 31, 2021, the publication of London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and euro settings as well as the one-week and two-month US LIBOR settings. The Bank continues to progress on its transition plan for the overnight, one-month, three month, six-month and twelve-month US LIBOR settings which will cease to be published immediately after June 30, 2023. On May 16, 2022, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Ltd. (RBSL), the administrator of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), announced that the calculation and publication of all tenors of CDOR will permanently cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. The announcement follows the completion of RBSL’s public consultation regarding the potential cessation of CDOR. CDOR is currently the primary interest rate benchmark in Canada and is widely used in",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report highlights its securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements, which remain unchanged from the previous quarter. The bank securitizes various assets, including residential mortgages, personal loans, credit card loans, and business and government loans, to enhance liquidity, diversify funding sources, and optimize balance sheet management. These securitizations involve both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities (SEs) and may result in full derecognition of assets, with the bank retaining some risks through retained interests. The bank also securitizes third-party originated assets through Canadian multi-seller conduits, with a potential exposure to loss of $10.6 billion as of July 31, 2022. Additionally, the bank has off-balance sheet exposure to third-party sponsored conduits amounting to $3.0 billion. The report notes no new accounting policies adopted during the period and emphasizes the importance of accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions. The bank is progressing with its transition plan for the cessation of LIBOR and CDOR benchmarks, with CDOR set to cease publication after June 28, 2024."

The Bank has incorporated this development into its benchmark rate reform plan to ensure an orderly transition and to manage the impact through appropriate mitigating actions. These actions include incorporating appropriate fallback language in contracts, making available new products referencing the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) or other alternative reference rates (ARRs), preparing to cease the issuance of CDOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy CDOR-based contracts, and preparing for overall operational readiness. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The ECL model requires the application of estimates and judgment in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. The following standard has been issued but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of applying the standard on the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and will adopt the standard when it becomes effective. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the Bank. OSFI’s related advisory precludes early adoption. The standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The Bank is proceeding with the implementation efforts accordingly. During the most recent interim period, there have been no changes in the Bank’s policies and procedures and other processes that comprise its internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting.",
        "summary": "The text outlines TD Bank Group's strategies and preparations for transitioning away from the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) to alternative reference rates like the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA). This includes updating contracts with fallback language, ceasing CDOR-based financial instruments, and ensuring operational readiness. The bank is also managing expected credit losses (ECL) amid economic uncertainty, applying expert judgment and temporary adjustments to their models. Additionally, TD Bank is preparing to implement IFRS 17 for insurance contracts, effective November 1, 2023, which will change how insurance contracts are recognized and measured. There have been no significant changes in the bank's internal control over financial reporting during the recent interim period."

To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts reported results for “items of note”. The items of note relate to items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance. Allowance for Credit Losses: Represent expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. Allowance for credit losses consists of Stage 3 allowance for impaired financial assets and Stage 2 and Stage 1 allowance for performing financial assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals, and impacted by foreign exchange. Amortized Cost: The amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization, using EIRM, of any differences between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. Assets under Administration (AUA): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers where the Bank provides services of an administrative nature, such as the collection of investment income and the placing of trades on behalf of the clients (where the client has made his or her own investment selection). The majority of these assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets under Management (AUM): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers, managed by the Bank, where the Bank has discretion to make investment selections on behalf of the client (in accordance with an investment policy). In addition to the TD family of mutual funds, the Bank manages assets on behalf of individuals, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments and foundations. These assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Some assets under management that are also administered by the Bank are included in assets under administration. Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP): A form of commercial paper that is collateralized by other financial assets. Institutional investors usually purchase such instruments in order to diversify their assets and generate short-term gains. Asset-Backed Securities (ABS): A security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or “backed”) by a specified pool of underlying assets. Average Common Equity: Average common equity for the business segments reflects the average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Average Interest-Earning Assets: A non-GAAP financial measure that depicts the Bank’s financial position, and is calculated as the average carrying value of deposits with banks, loans and securities based on daily balances for the period ending October 31 in each fiscal year. Basic Earnings per Share (EPS): A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted basic EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Basis Points (bps): A unit equal to 1/100 of 1%. Thus, a 1% change is equal to 100 basis points. Book Value per Share: A measure calculated by dividing common shareholders’ equity by number of common shares at the end of the period. Carrying Value: The value at which an asset or liability is carried at on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO): They are collateralized debt obligations consisting of mortgage-backed securities that are separated and issued as different classes of mortgage pass-through securities with different terms, interest rates, and risks. CMOs by private issuers are collectively referred to as non-agency CMOs. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: This is a primary Basel III capital measure comprised mainly of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. Regulatory deductions made to arrive at the CET1 Capital include goodwill and intangibles, unconsolidated investments in banking, financial, and insurance entities, deferred tax assets, defined benefit pension fund assets, and shortfalls in allowances. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio: CET1 Capital ratio represents the predominant measure of capital adequacy under Basel III and equals CET1 Capital divided by RWA. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): A measure of growth over multiple time periods from the initial investment value to the ending investment value assuming that the investment has been compounding over the time period. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA): CVA represents a capital charge that measures credit risk due to default of derivative counterparties. This charge requires banks to capitalize for the potential changes in counterparty credit spread for the derivative portfolios. Diluted EPS: A performance measur e calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusting for the effect of all potentially dilutive common shares. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Payout Ratio: A ratio represents the percentage of Bank’s earnings being paid to common shareholders in the form of dividends and is calculated by dividing common dividends by net income available to common shareholders. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Yield: A ratio calculated as the dividend per common share for the year divided by the daily average closing stock price during the year. Effective Income Tax Rate: A rate and performance indicator calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes as a percentage of net income before taxes. Adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated in the same manner using adjusted results. Effective Interest Rate (EIR): The rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The calculation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts. Effective Interest Rate Method (EIRM): A technique for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument’s book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Under EIRM, the effective interest rate, which is a key component of the calculation, discounts the expected future cash inflows and outflows expected over the life of a financial instrument.",

A lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted non-interest expenses and total revenue. Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF): Established by the Financial Stability Board in May 2012, comprised of banks, analysts, investors, and auditors, with the goal of enhancing the risk disclosures of banks and other financial institutions. Expected Credit Losses (ECLs): ECLs are the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions that impact the Bank’s credit risk assessment. Fair Value: The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Under IFRS 9, if the asset passes the contractual cash flows test (named SPPI), the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classified. If the instrument is being held to collect contractual cash flows, that is, if it is not expected to be sold, it is measured as amortized cost. If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is measured at FVOCI. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Under IFRS 9, the classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI) and a business model assessment. Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in profit or loss. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): A U.S. government corporation which provides deposit insurance guaranteeing the safety of a depositor’s accounts in member banks. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in receiverships (failed banks). Forward Contracts: Over-the-counter contracts between two parties that oblige one party to the contract to buy and the other party to sell an asset for a fixed price at a future date. Futures: Exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Hedging: A risk management technique intended to mitigate the Bank’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other market factors. The elimination or reduction of such exposure is accomplished by engaging in capital markets activities to establish offsetting positions. Impaired Loans: Loans where, in management’s opinion, there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent that the Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. Loss Given Default (LGD): It is the amount of the loss the Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a loan, which is expressed as a percentage of exposure at default. Mark-to-Market (MTM): A valuation that reflects current market rates as at the balance sheet date for financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Master Netting Agreements: Legal agreements between two parties that have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default or termination of any one contract. Net Corporate Expenses: Non-interest expenses related to corporate service and control groups which are not allocated to a business segment. Net Interest Margin: A non-GAAP ratio calculated as net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to measure performance. This metric is an indicator of the profitability of the Bank’s earning assets less the cost of funding. Adjusted net interest margin is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net interest income. Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC): Instruments (preferred shares and subordinated debt) that contain a feature or a provision that allows the financial institution to either permanently convert these instruments into common shares or fully write-down the instrument, in the event that the institution is no longer viable. Notional: A reference amount on which payments for derivative financial instruments are based. Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI): The regulator of Canadian federally chartered financial institutions and federally administered pension plans. Options: Contracts in which the writer of the option grants the buyer the future right, but not the obligation, to buy or to sell a security, exchange rate, interest rate, or other financial instrument or commodity at a predetermined price at or by a specified future date. Price-Earnings Ratio: A ratio calculated by dividing the closing share price by EPS based on a trailing four quarters to indicate market performance. Adjusted price-earnings ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted EPS. Probability of Default (PD): It is the likelihood that a borrower will not be able to meet its scheduled repayments. Provision for Credit Losses (PCL): Amount added to the allowance for credit losses to bring it to a level that management considers adequate to reflect expected credit-related losses on its portfolio. Return on Common Equity (ROE): The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity, utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. Adjusted ROE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Return on Risk-weighted Assets: Net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average risk-weighted assets. Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a percentage of average Tangible common equity. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Both measures can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA): Assets calculated by applying a regulatory risk-weight factor to on and off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight factors are established by the OSFI to convert on and off-balance sheet exposures to a comparable risk level.",

Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI): IFRS 9 requires that the following criteria be met in order for a financial instrument to be classified at amortized cost: • The entity’s business model relates to managing financial assets (such as bank trading activity), and, as such, an asset is held with the intention of collecting its contractual cash flows; and • An asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI. Swaps: Contracts that involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payment obligations and currencies on a notional principal for a specified period of time. Tangible common equity (TCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as common shareholders’ equity less goodwill, imputed goodwill, and intangibles on an investment in Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other acquired intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. It can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Taxable Equivalent Basis (TEB): A calculation method (not defined in GAAP) that increases revenues and the provision for income taxes on certain tax exempt securities to an equivalent before-tax basis to facilitate comparison of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Tier 1 Capital Ratio: Tier 1 Capital represents the more permanent forms of capital, consisting primarily of common shareholders’ equity, retained earnings, preferred shares and innovative instruments. Tier 1 Capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 Capital divided by RWA. Total Capital Ratio: Total Capital is defined as the total of net Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital. Total Capital ratio is calculated as Total Capital divided by RWA. Total Shareholder Return (TSR): The change in market price plus dividends paid during the year as a percentage of the prior year’s closing market price per common share. Trading-Related Revenue: A non-GAAP financial measure that is the total of trading income (loss), net interest income on trading positions, and income from financial instruments designated at FVTPL that are managed within a trading portfolio. Trading-related revenue (TEB) in the Wholesale Banking segment, which is part of the total Bank’s trading-related revenue, is also a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in the same manner, including TEB adjustments. Both are used for measuring trading performance. Value-at-Risk (VaR): A metric used to monitor and control overall risk levels and to calculate the regulatory capital required for market risk in trading activities. VaR measures the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of time.",

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 financial report highlights several key insights:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet Growth**: Total assets increased to $1,840.8 billion as of July 31, 2022, from $1,728.7 billion on October 31, 2021. This growth was driven by increases in loans, particularly residential mortgages and business loans.\n\n2. **Income Statement**: Net income for the three months ended July 31, 2022, was $3,214 million, down from $3,545 million in the same period in 2021. For the nine months ended July 31, 2022, net income was $10,758 million, slightly up from $10,517 million in 2021.\n\n3. **Interest Income and Expenses**: Interest income rose significantly due to higher loan and securities interest, while interest expenses also increased, leading to a net interest income of $7,044 million for the quarter.\n\n4. **Non-Interest Income**: There was a decline in non-interest income, primarily due to a trading loss and lower investment and securities services income.\n\n5. **Credit Losses**: The provision for credit losses was $351 million for the quarter, indicating a shift from a recovery position in the previous year.\n\n6. **Equity and Dividends**: Shareholders' equity increased to $102.6 billion, with common dividends per share rising to $0.89 from $0.79 in the previous year.\n\n7. **Cash Flows**: Operating activities generated $18,909 million in cash, while investing activities used $18,106 million, and financing activities used $755 million.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group showed asset growth and stable net income despite increased interest expenses and credit loss provisions."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 55 NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) NOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS The Toronto-Dominion Bank is a bank chartered under the Bank Act. The shareholders of a bank are not, as shareholders, liable for any liability, act, or default of the bank except as otherwise provided under the Bank Act. The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”). The Bank was formed through the amalgamation on February 1, 1955, of The Bank of Toronto (chartered in 1855) and The Dominion Bank (chartered in 1869). The Bank is incorporated and domiciled in Canada with its registered and principal business offices located at 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario. TD serves customers in three business segments operating in a number of locations in key financial centres around the globe: Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking. The accompanying Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting principles followed by the Bank have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including the accounting requirements of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. These Interim Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on a condensed basis in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting using the accounting policies as described in Note 2 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain comparative amounts have been revised to conform with the presentation adopted in the current period. The preparation of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements requires that management make judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as further described in Note 3 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 3 of this report. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future confirming events occur. The Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. All intercompany transactions, balances, and unrealized gains and losses on transactions are eliminated on consolidation. The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022, were approved and authorized for issue by the Bank’s Board of Directors, in accordance with a recommendation of the Audit Committee, on August 24, 2022. As the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the disclosures normally provided in the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, they should be read in conjunction with the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes, and the shaded sections of the 2021 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The risk management policies and procedures of the Bank are provided in the MD&A. The shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the MD&A in this report, relating to market, liquidity, and insurance risks, are an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, as permitted by IFRS. NOTE 2: CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES There were no new accounting policies that have been adopted by the Bank for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022. The following standard has been issued but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of applying the standard on the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and will adopt the standard when it becomes effective. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the Bank. OSFI’s related advisory precludes early adoption. The standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The Bank is proceeding with the implementation efforts accordingly.",
        "summary": "The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank Group) operates under the Bank Act and serves customers through Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking segments globally. The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the third quarter of 2022 were prepared in accordance with IFRS and approved by the Board of Directors on August 24, 2022. These statements are presented in Canadian dollars and require management to make estimates and judgments. No new accounting policies were adopted during this period. The Bank is assessing the impact of IFRS 17, a new standard for insurance contracts effective from November 1, 2023, which will replace IFRS 4 and requires retrospective application with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The Bank's risk management policies are detailed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)."

        "chunk": "- TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 56 NOTE 3: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Effective December 31, 2021, the publication of London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and euro settings as well as the one-week and two-month US LIBOR settings. The Bank continues to progress on its transition plan for the overnight, one-month, three month, six-month and twelve-month US LIBOR settings which will cease to be published immediately after June 30, 2023. On May 16, 2022, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Ltd. (RBSL), the administrator of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), announced that the calculation and publication of all tenors of CDOR will permanently cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. The announcement follows the completion of RBSL’s public consultation regarding the potential cessation of CDOR. CDOR is currently the primary interest rate benchmark in Canada and is widely used in Canadian dollar financial instruments including derivatives, loans, floating rate notes, and as a daily benchmark reference rate for Canadian Bankers’ Acceptance (BA) borrowings. The Bank has incorporated this development into its benchmark rate reform plan to ensure an orderly transition and to manage the impact through appropriate mitigating actions. These actions include incorporating appropriate fallback language in contracts, making available new products referencing the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) or other alternative reference rates (ARRs), preparing to cease the issuance of CDOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy CDOR-based contracts, and preparing for overall operational readiness. The following table discloses the Bank’s exposure to financial instruments referencing CDOR that have yet to transition to an ARR and mature after June 28, 2024, including certain demand deposits that have no specific maturity. Exposures to Interest Rate Benchmarks Subject to IBOR Reform (millions of Canadian dollars) As at July 31, 2022 Non-derivative financial assets 1 Non-derivative financial liabilities 2 Derivatives Off-balance sheet commitments 3 Carrying amount Carrying amount Notional 4 Positive fair value Negative fair value Contractual amount CDOR $ 18,137 $ 29,523 $ 2,510,492 $ 2,362 $ 3,373 $ 26,864 Cross-currency swaps CDOR/ US LIBOR n/a 5 n/a 132,965 1,574 1,617 n/a CDOR / other rates 6 n/a n/a 75,431 1,002 1,463 n/a n/a n/a 208,396 2,576 3,080 n/a Total $ 18,137 $ 29,523 $ 2,718,888 $ 4,938 $ 6,453 $ 26,864 1 Loans reported under non-derivative financial assets represent the drawn amounts and exclude allowance for loan losses. As at July 31, 2022, the carrying amount of non-derivative financial assets indexed to CDOR was $18 billion, of which $12 billion relates to Customers’ liability under acceptances, $2 billion relates to Loans, and $2 billion relates to Debt securities at amortized cost. 2 As at July 31, 2022, the carrying amount of non-derivative financial liabilities indexed to CDOR was $30 billion, of which $12 billion relates to Acceptances, $9 billion relates to Subordinated notes and debentures, and $5 billion relates to demand deposits with no specific maturity. 3 Many of the Bank’s corporate loan facilities permit the borrower to select the benchmark interest rate upon drawing on the facility. Based on the Bank’s historical experience, the benchmark interest rate selected by the borrower is often the same as the facility currency and therefore the Bank has assumed that the benchmark interest rate for its undrawn credit and liquidity commitments is the same as the facility currency for the purpose of this disclosure. 4 As at July 31, 2022, the notional amount of derivatives indexed to CDOR 1-month and 3-month tenors in qualifying hedge accounting relationships that are maturing after June 28, 2024 and have yet to transition to an ARR was $124 billion for those hedging interest rate risk and $98 billion for those hedging foreign exchange risk. 5 Not applicable. 6 “Other rates” refer to rates that are not subject to IBOR reform or have already been reformed. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The expected credit loss (ECL) model requires the application of estimates and judgment in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report highlights the significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions that are crucial for understanding its financial results and condition. The report emphasizes the complexity and subjectivity involved in these estimates, which can materially impact the bank's financial statements. The bank has procedures to ensure consistent application of accounting policies and systematic adoption of new standards.\n\nA major focus is the transition from the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) to alternative reference rates (ARRs) due to benchmark reforms. The bank is actively managing this transition by incorporating fallback language in contracts, offering new products based on ARRs, and preparing for operational readiness. As of July 31, 2022, the bank has significant exposure to financial instruments indexed to CDOR, with plans to transition these to ARRs by June 28, 2024.\n\nAdditionally, the report discusses the expected credit loss (ECL) model, which requires judgment in assessing economic conditions and credit risk. Due to economic uncertainty, the bank applies temporary adjustments to its ECL calculations."

TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 59 (c) TRANSFERS BETWEEN FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY LEVELS FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS The Bank’s policy is to record transfers of assets and liabilities between the different levels of the fair value hierarchy using the fair values as at the end of each reporting period. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022 or the three months ended July 31, 2021. During the nine months ended July 31, 2021, $400 million of fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Canadian government debt were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1. There were no significant transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022, or the three months ended July 31, 2021. During the nine months ended July 31, 2021, transfers were made out of Level 3 and into Level 2 for trading deposits and equity contracts due to changes in the degree of observability of certain inputs in the fair value measurement of these instruments. There were no other significant changes to the unobservable inputs and sensitivities for assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022 and July 31, 2021.

TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 63 (d) CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT SECURITIES The Bank evaluates non-retail credit risk on an individual borrower basis, using both a borrower risk rating (BRR) and facility risk rating, as detailed in the shaded area of the “Managing Risk” section of the 2021 MD&A. This system is used to assess all non-retail exposures, including debt securities. The following table provides the gross carrying amounts of debt securities measured at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI by internal risk ratings for credit risk management purposes, presenting separately those debt securities that are subject to Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 allowances. Refer to the “Allowance for Credit Losses” table in Note 6 for details regarding the allowance and provision for credit losses on debt securities.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report highlights the following key insights regarding fair value measurements and financial assets and liabilities:\n\n1. **Fair Value Measurements**: There were no significant changes in the methodologies used to determine fair value measurements for the periods ending July 31, 2022. The report provides detailed fair value assessments of financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, showing slight discrepancies between carrying values and fair values.\n\n2. **Fair Value Hierarchy**: The report categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into three levels based on the observability of inputs. There were no significant transfers between these levels during the reported periods, indicating stability in the valuation processes.\n\n3. **Level 3 Assets and Liabilities**: The report includes a reconciliation of changes in fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities, which rely on significant unobservable inputs. There were minor movements and transfers within this category, with some realized and unrealized gains and losses reported.\n\n4. **Unrealized Gains and Losses**: The report details unrealized gains and losses on securities at fair value through other comprehensive income, noting a decrease in both gains and losses compared to the previous period.\n\n5. **Credit Quality and Risk Ratings**: The bank evaluates credit risk using internal risk ratings, with most debt securities classified as investment grade. The allowance for credit losses remains minimal, indicating a stable credit environment.\n\n6. **Loans and Acceptances**: There was an increase in total loans and acceptances, with residential mortgages and business loans showing significant growth. The allowance for loan losses decreased slightly, reflecting improved credit conditions.\n\nOverall, the report suggests a stable financial position for TD Bank Group, with consistent valuation methodologies and a strong credit quality profile."

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report highlights the allowance for credit losses as of July 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The total allowance for credit losses, including off-balance sheet instruments, was CAD 6,921 million for the three months ended July 31, 2022, slightly up from CAD 6,915 million at the beginning of the period. For the nine months ended July 31, 2022, the allowance decreased from CAD 7,255 million to CAD 6,921 million. The report details changes in allowances across various categories, including residential mortgages, consumer installment and other personal loans, credit cards, and business and government loans. The allowance for loan losses is broken down by stages, reflecting credit risk migration and changes in risk parameters. Overall, the report indicates a slight decrease in total allowances over the nine-month period, with adjustments reflecting changes in credit risk and economic conditions."

        "chunk": "- - - - TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 71 (e) FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Relevant macroeconomic factors are incorporated in risk parameters as appropriate. Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. The key macroeconomic variables used in determining ECLs include regional unemployment rates for all retail exposures and regional housing price indices for residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. For business and government loans, the key macroeconomic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, and credit spreads. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of how forward-looking information is generated and considered in determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and in measuring ECLs. Macroeconomic Variables Select macroeconomic variables are projected over the forecast period. The following table represents the average values of the macroeconomic variables over the four calendar quarters starting with the current quarter, and the remaining 4-year forecast period for the base forecast and upside and downside scenarios used in determining the Bank’s ECLs as at July 31, 2022. As the forecast period increases, information about the future becomes less readily available and projections are anchored on assumptions around structural relationships between economic parameters that are inherently much less certain. The economy has made substantial progress in recovering from the economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, while economic risks from the pandemic are receding, new risks, such as rising geopolitical tensions and heightened inflationary pressures that have led to a rapid tightening in monetary policy, continue to result in elevated economic uncertainty. Macroeconomic Variables As at July 31, 2022 Base Forecast Upside Scenario Downside Scenario Average Q3 2022 Q2 2023 1 Remaining 4-year period 1 Average Q3 2022 Q2 2023 1 Remaining 4-year period 1 Average Q3 2022 Q2 2023 1 Remaining 4-year period 1 Unemployment rate Canada 5.4 % 6.0 % 5.1 % 5.4 % 7.4 % 6.8 % United States 3.7 4.1 3.4 3.6 5.6 4.9 Real GDP Canada 2.9 1.5 3.9 1.5 (0.3) 2.3 United States 1.5 1.8 2.5 1.7 (1.8) 2.6 Home prices Canada (average existing price) 2 (12.1) 3.0 (5.5) 2.3 (18.6) 4.4 United States (CoreLogic HPI) 3 4.7 2.2 8.3 2.5 1.4 2.8 Central bank policy interest rate Canada 3.19 2.27 3.31 3.17 0.88 0.58 United States 3.19 2.39 3.31 3.27 0.81 0.69 U.S. 10-year treasury yield 3.43 2.88 3.57 3.32 2.29 2.46 U.S. 10-year BBB spread (%-pts) 1.81 1.80 1.72 1.69 2.34 1.77 Exchange rate (U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar) $ 0.79 $ 0.79 $ 0.81 $ 0.80 $ 0.74 $ 0.79 1 The numbers represent average values for the quoted periods, and average of year-on-year growth for real GDP and home prices. 2 The average home price is the average transacted sale price of homes sold via the Multiple Listing Service; data is collected by the Canadian Real Estate Association. 3 The CoreLogic home price index (HPI) is a repeat-sales index which tracks increases and decreases in the same home’s sales price over time. (f) SENSITIVITY OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ECLs are sensitive to the inputs used in internally developed models, the macroeconomic variables in the forward-looking forecasts and respective probability weightings in determining the probability-weighted ECLs, and other factors considered when applying expert credit judgment. Changes in these inputs, assumptions, models, and judgments would affect the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of ECLs. The following table presents the base ECL scenario compared to the probability-weighted ECLs, with the latter derived from three ECL scenarios for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The difference reflects the impact of deriving multiple scenarios around the base ECLs and resultant change in ECLs due to non-linearity and sensitivity to using macroeconomic forecasts. Change from Base to Probability-Weighted ECLs (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) As at July 31, 2022 October 31, 2021 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 6,208 $ 6,608 Base ECLs 5,844 6,412 Difference – in amount $ 364 $ 196 Difference – in percentage 6.2 % 3.1 % ECLs for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments consist of an aggregate amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 probability-weighted ECLs which are twelve month ECLs and lifetime ECLs, respectively. Transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2 ECLs result from a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the loan. The following table shows the estimated impact of staging on ECLs by presenting all performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments calculated using twelve-month ECLs compared to the current aggregate probability-weighted ECLs, holding all risk profiles constant. Incremental Lifetime ECLs Impact (millions of Canadian dollars) As at July 31, 2022 October 31, 2021 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 6,208 $ 6,608 All performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments using 12-month ECLs 4,574 4,903 Incremental lifetime ECLs impact $ 1,634 $ 1,705",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report highlights the incorporation of macroeconomic factors into risk parameters for expected credit losses (ECLs). Key variables include unemployment rates, GDP, interest rates, and housing prices. The report notes that while the economy is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, new risks such as geopolitical tensions and inflation are increasing economic uncertainty. The bank uses base, upside, and downside scenarios to project these variables over a forecast period, acknowledging the uncertainty in long-term projections. The report also discusses the sensitivity of ECLs to changes in inputs and assumptions, showing a difference between base and probability-weighted ECLs due to non-linearity and sensitivity to macroeconomic forecasts. As of July 31, 2022, probability-weighted ECLs were higher than base ECLs, reflecting the impact of multiple scenarios. The report also details the impact of staging on ECLs, with significant increases in credit risk leading to transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2 ECLs."

On January 12, 2022, it was announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, for all eligible borrowers in good standing. If the loan is not repaid by December 31, 2023, it will be extended for an additional 2-year term bearing an interest rate of 5% per annum. The application window for new CEBA loans and expansion requests closed on June 30, 2021. The funding provided to the Bank by the Government of Canada in respect of the CEBA Program represents an obligation to pass-through collections on the CEBA loans and is otherwise non-recourse to the Bank. Accordingly, the Bank is required to remit all collections of principal and interest on the CEBA loans to the Government of Canada but is not required to repay amounts that its customers fail to pay or that have been forgiven. The Bank receives an administration fee to recover the costs to administer the program for the Government of Canada. Loans issued under the program are not recognized on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as the Bank transfers substantially all risks and rewards in respect of the loans to the Government of Canada. NOTE 7: INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES The Bank has significant influence over The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) and the ability to participate in the financial and operating policy-making decisions of Schwab through a combination of the Bank’s ownership, board representation and the insured deposit account agreement between the Bank and Schwab (the “Schwab IDA Agreement”). As such, the Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The Bank’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. The Bank takes into account changes in the subsequent period that would significantly affect the results. As at July 31, 2022, the Bank’s reported investment in Schwab was approximately 13.4% (October 31, 2021 – 13.4%), consisting of 9.6% of the outstanding voting common shares and the remainder in non-voting common shares of Schwab with a fair value of $22 billion (US$18 billion) (October 31, 2021 – $26 billion (US$21 billion)) based on the closing price of US$69.05 (October 31, 2021 – US$82.03) on the New York Stock Exchange. The Bank and Schwab are party to a stockholder agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”) under which the Bank has the right to designate two members of Schwab’s Board of Directors and has representation on two Board Committees, subject to the Bank meeting certain conditions. The Bank’s designated directors currently are the Bank’s Group President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank’s Chair of the Board. Under the Stockholder Agreement, the Bank is not permitted to own more than 9.9% voting common shares of Schwab, and the Bank is subject to customary standstill restrictions and subject to certain exceptions, transfer restrictions. In addition, the Schwab IDA Agreement has an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. On August 1, 2022, in order to provide the capital required for the acquisition of Cowen Inc. (“Cowen”), the Bank sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Schwab at a price of US$66.53 per share for proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion (US$1.9 billion). Approximately 15 million shares were sold to Schwab pursuant to a repurchase agreement at a price equal to the price obtained in the sale of 13.4 million shares sold to a broker dealer pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933. All shares sold automatically converted into shares of Schwab voting common stock and the shares acquired by Schwab are no longer outstanding. The sales reduced the Bank’s ownership interest in Schwab from approximately 13.4% to 12.0%. The Bank is expected to recognize approximately $1 billion (US$770 million) as other income (net of $370 million (US$290 million) loss from AOCI reclassified to earnings), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.",
        "summary": "The text provides several financial insights regarding TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report:\n\n1. **Foreclosed Assets**: TD Bank holds foreclosed assets, primarily real estate, valued at $48 million as of July 31, 2022, down from $53 million on October 31, 2021. These assets are managed for sale to repay outstanding debts.\n\n2. **Loans Past Due but Not Impaired**: The report details loans that are past due but not impaired, with a total of $1.902 billion as of July 31, 2022, compared to $2.182 billion on October 31, 2021. This includes residential mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards, and business loans.\n\n3. **Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) Program**: TD Bank participates in the CEBA program, providing interest-free, partially forgivable loans to businesses. The repayment deadline for these loans has been extended to December 31, 2023. The bank does not recognize these loans on its balance sheet as it transfers the risks and rewards to the Government of Canada.\n\n4. **Investment in Schwab**: TD Bank holds a significant investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation, accounting for it using the equity method. As of July 31, 2022, the bank's ownership was approximately 13.4%, which was reduced to 12.0% after selling 28.4 million non-voting shares to fund the acquisition of Cowen Inc. This sale is expected to generate approximately $1 billion in other income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022."

On August 2, 2022, the Bank and Cowen announced a definitive agreement for TD to acquire Cowen in an all-cash transaction valued at US$1.3 billion, or US$39.00 for each share of Cowen common stock. The transaction is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from Cowen’s stockholders and certain U.S., Canadian, and foreign regulatory authorities. The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and reported in the Wholesale Banking segment. Acquisition of First Horizon Corporation On February 28, 2022, the Bank and First Horizon Corporation (“First Horizon”) announced a definitive agreement for the Bank to acquire First Horizon in an all cash transaction valued at US$13.4 billion, or US$25.00 for each common share of First Horizon. In connection with this transaction, the Bank has invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock (convertible in certain circumstances into up to 4.9% of First Horizon’s common stock). The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from First Horizon’s shareholders and U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities. The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and reported in the U.S. Retail segment. If the transaction does not close prior to November 27, 2022, First Horizon shareholders will receive, at closing, an additional US$0.65 per share on an annualized basis for the period from November 27, 2022 through the day immediately prior to the closing. Either party will have the right to terminate the agreement if the transaction has not closed by February 27, 2023 (the “outside date”), subject to the right of either party (under certain conditions) to extend the outside date to May 27, 2023. During the quarter, the Bank implemented a strategy to mitigate interest rate volatility to capital on closing of the acquisition. The fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets are sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets will determine the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles will negatively impact capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships. After the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps are being recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments, which will mitigate the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the investments. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022, the Bank recognized $(721) million in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $43 million in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization.

At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion, or from the open market at market price. The Bank had determined that, beginning with the dividend approved on May 25, 2022 for the quarter ending July 31, 2022, and until further announcement, the Bank will issue the common shares from treasury and will apply a 2% discount to the average market price of such common shares. During the three months ended July 31, 2022, the Bank issued 7.5 million common shares from treasury with a 2% discount. During the nine months ended July 31, 2022, the Bank issued 2.5 million common shares from treasury with no discount and 7.5 million common shares with a 2% discount. During the three and nine months ended July 31, 2021, the Bank issued 1.2 million and 3.9 million common shares, respectively, from treasury with no discount.",

As at July 31, 2022, the CRA has reassessed the Bank for $1,186 million of income tax and interest for the years 2011 to 2016, the RQA has reassessed the Bank for $34 million for the years 2011 to 2015, and the ATRA has reassessed the Bank for $54 million for the years 2011 to 2016. On August 12, 2022, the CRA reassessed the Bank for $460 million of additional income tax and interest in respect of its 2017 taxation year. In total, the Bank has been reassessed for $1,734 million of income tax and interest related to these transactions. The Bank expects to continue to be reassessed for open years. The Bank is of the view that its tax filing positions were appropriate and intends to challenge all reassessments. Proposed Tax Measures in the Canadian Federal Budget The Canadian Federal budget presented on April 7, 2022, proposed to introduce a tax on bank and life insurer groups, referred to as the Canada Recovery Dividend (“CRD”), and also an additional permanent tax. On August 9, 2022, the first draft of the legislation was released by the Ministry of Finance. This draft legislation proposes the CRD to be a 15% tax on an average of 2020 and 2021 taxable income above $1 billion, paid in equal instalments over five years. The draft legislation also proposes to introduce an additional permanent tax on bank and life insurer groups of 1.5% of taxable income above $100 million. The additional tax would apply to taxation years that end after April 7, 2022 and will be prorated for the first year. These taxes, if enacted as proposed, will result in higher amounts of taxes payable in each of the impacted years, as well as revaluation adjustments to the deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Bank is continuing to monitor the status of the Budget proposals and draft legislation, and will determine the impact to the Bank’s results when the legislation is substantively enacted.",
        "summary": "The financial text provides insights into TD Bank Group's pension plan expenses, remeasurements of defined benefit plans, and tax-related issues for the third quarter of 2022. Key points include:\n\n1. **Defined Contribution Plan Expenses**: For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022, expenses increased compared to the same periods in 2021. The total expenses for the three months were $145 million (up from $127 million in 2021), and for the nine months, $483 million (up from $432 million in 2021).\n\n2. **Remeasurements in Other Comprehensive Income**: The bank reported significant remeasurement gains and losses for its principal pension and post-retirement benefit plans. For the three months ended July 31, 2022, there was a total remeasurement gain of $387 million for post-retirement plans and a loss of $6 million for pension plans. For the nine months, the gains were $1,428 million and $76 million, respectively.\n\n3. **Income Tax Reassessments**: The Canada Revenue Agency, Revenu Québec Agency, and Alberta Tax and Revenue Administration have reassessed the bank for a total of $1,734 million in income tax and interest for various years. The bank plans to challenge these reassessments, maintaining that its tax positions were appropriate.\n\n4. **Proposed Tax Measures**: The Canadian Federal Budget proposed new taxes on bank and life insurer groups, including a Canada Recovery Dividend and an additional permanent tax. These measures, if enacted, will increase the bank's tax liabilities and require adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities. The bank is monitoring the situation to assess the impact on its financial results."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 79 NOTE 17: EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the same method as basic earnings per share except that certain adjustments are made to net income attributable to common shareholders and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares that are assumed to be issued by the Bank. The following table presents the Bank’s basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022 and July 31, 2021. Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) For the three months ended For the nine months ended July 31 2022 July 31 2021 July 31 2022 July 31 2021 Basic earnings per share Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,171 $ 3,489 $ 10,606 $ 10,331 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (millions) 1,804.5 1,818.8 1,810.0 1,816.8 Basic earnings per share (Canadian dollars) $ 1.76 $ 1.92 $ 5.86 $ 5.69 Diluted earnings per share Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,171 $ 3,489 $ 10,606 $ 10,331 Net income available to common shareholders including impact of dilutive securities 3,171 3,489 10,606 10,331 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (millions) 1,804.5 1,818.8 1,810.0 1,816.8 Effect of dilutive securities Stock options potentially exercisable (millions) 1 2.6 3.0 3.3 2.4 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding – diluted (millions) 1,807.1 1,821.8 1,813.3 1,819.2 Diluted earnings per share (Canadian dollars) 1 $ 1.75 $ 1.92 $ 5.85 $ 5.68 1 For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022, the computation of diluted earnings per share excluded average options outstanding of 2.4 million and 2.0 million, respectively, with an exercise price of $95.33, as the option price was greater than the average market price of the Bank’s common shares. For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2021, no outstanding options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. NOTE 18: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Other than as described below, there have been no new significant events or transactions as previously identified in Note 27 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, including but not limited to civil claims and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits and requests for information by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions. The Bank establishes provisions when it becomes probable that the Bank will incur a loss and the amount can be reliably estimated. The Bank also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) in its legal and regulatory actions (that is, those which are neither probable nor remote), in excess of provisions. As at July 31, 2022, the Bank’s RPL is from zero to approximately $1.39 billion (October 31, 2021 – from zero to approximately $1.45 billion). The Bank’s provisions and RPL represent the Bank’s best estimates based upon currently available information for actions for which estimates can be made, but there are a number of factors that could cause the Bank’s provisions and/or RPL to be significantly different from its actual or RPL. For example, the Bank’s estimates involve significant judgment due to the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants in many proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, some of which are beyond the Bank’s control and/or involve novel legal theories and interpretations, the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. In addition, some actions seek very large or indeterminate damages. In management’s opinion, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the ultimate disposition of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or the consolidated cash flows of the Bank. However, because of the factors listed above, as well as other uncertainties inherent in litigation and regulatory matters, there is a possibility that the ultimate resolution of legal or regulatory actions may be material to the Bank’s consolidated results of operations for any particular reporting period. Stanford Litigation – On January 20, 2022, in the US Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al action, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Bank’s motion for summary judgment. Also on January 20, 2022, the Rotstain Court issued a Suggestion of Remand that recommended to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) that the Rotstain matter be remanded for further proceedings to the Southern District of Texas. That day, the JPML issued a Conditional Remand Order, which took effect on January 27, 2022. On March 10, 2022, the Rotstain matter was transferred to the Southern District of Texas. On April 29, 2022, the bank defendants, including the Bank, moved to dismiss certain of plaintiffs’ claims for lack of jurisdiction and lack of standing. Briefing on the bank defendants’ motion to dismiss was completed on May 27, 2022. On May 23, 2022, the Bank also filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that all of the claims asserted by the Official Stanford Investors Committee (OSIC) are precluded by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice’s June 8, 2021 judgment. On June 13, 2022, OSIC filed an opposition to the Bank’s summary judgment motion and cross-moved for summary judgment on the Bank’s affirmative defenses of res judicata and collateral estoppel. Briefing on the motions was completed on July 12, 2022. On June 9, 2022, the Court entered an order setting the Rotstain matter for trial beginning on February 27, 2023. A joint status report was filed in the Smith v. Independent Bank et al. action on January 31, 2022. In the report, the removing bank defendant requested a status conference to address how to resolve the overlapping issues with the Rotstain litigation. Plaintiffs’ position is that the Smith matter should continue to be stayed. In Ontario, the hearing of the appeal in the Joint Liquidators’ action took place on April 20-21, 2022. The Court of Appeal for Ontario has taken the matter under reserve and will issue a written decision in due course.",
        "summary": "The financial text provides insights into TD Bank Group's earnings per share (EPS) and contingent liabilities for the third quarter of 2022. The basic EPS for the three months ended July 31, 2022, was CAD 1.76, down from CAD 1.92 in the same period in 2021. The diluted EPS was CAD 1.75, also down from CAD 1.92 in 2021. The text also discusses the bank's contingent liabilities, noting that the range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) as of July 31, 2022, is estimated between zero and approximately CAD 1.39 billion. The bank is involved in various legal and regulatory actions, including the Stanford Litigation, which is ongoing with proceedings in the Southern District of Texas and Ontario. Despite these legal challenges, management believes that the outcomes will not materially affect the bank's financial condition or cash flows, although they could impact results for specific reporting periods."

NOTE 21: REGULATORY CAPITAL The Bank manages its capital under guidelines established by OSFI. The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to credit, market, and operational risks. The Bank has various capital policies, procedures, and controls which it utilizes to achieve its goals and objectives. On November 22, 2019, the Bank was designated a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). During the nine months ended July 31, 2022, the Bank complied with the OSFI Basel III guidelines related to risk-based and leverage capital ratios. Effective January 1, 2016, OSFI’s target Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios for Canadian banks designated as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) includes a 1% common equity capital surcharge bringing the targets to 8%, 9.5%, and 11.5%, respectively. On June 25, 2018, OSFI provided greater transparency related to previously undisclosed Pillar 2 CET1 capital buffers through the introduction of the public domestic stability buffer (DSB) which is held by D-SIBs against Pillar 2 risks. The current buffer is set at 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets (RWA) and must be met with CET1 Capital, effectively raising the OSFI CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital minimum target ratios to 10.5%, 12.0% and 14.0%, respectively. The OSFI target includes the greater of the D-SIB or G SIB surcharge, both of which are currently 1%. On September 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guideline. Under this guideline, the Bank was required to meet supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.0% of RWA, inclusive of the 2.50% DSB, and TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75% by November 1, 2021. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio. The following table summarizes the Bank’s regulatory capital positions as at July 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial metrics and regulatory compliance updates. As of July 31, 2022, the bank's total assets increased to CAD 1,840,811 million from CAD 1,728,672 million as of October 31, 2021, with notable growth in the U.S. Retail and Wholesale Banking segments. Interest income for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2022, rose significantly compared to the same periods in 2021, driven by increases in income measured at amortized cost and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Interest expenses also increased, particularly for amounts measured at amortized cost.\n\nThe bank maintained compliance with the OSFI Basel III guidelines, with capital ratios exceeding the minimum requirements. As of July 31, 2022, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio was 14.9%, Tier 1 Capital ratio was 16.3%, and Total Capital ratio was 18.8%. The bank's Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) ratio improved to 32.0%, reflecting strong capital management. The report underscores TD Bank's robust financial position and adherence to regulatory capital requirements."
