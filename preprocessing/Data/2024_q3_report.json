        "page_content": "- - TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 6 a) Investigations Related to the Bank’s AML Program The Bank continues to actively pursue a global resolution of the civil and criminal investigations into its U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/AML program (the “AML Program”) by its U.S. prudential regulators, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). For additional information about these matters, including provisions recorded in connection with such investigations, refer to Note 19 of the Bank’s third quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. As previously disclosed, the Bank is undertaking a remediation of its AML Program. This is a cross-functional undertaking, spanning business lines and control functions, and is a priority for the Bank. As part of this work, the Bank has been making investments in its risk and controls infrastructure, including: (i) onboarding leadership with deep subject matter expertise supported by increased staffing resources; (ii) implementing new cross-functional procedures for preventing, detecting, and reporting suspicious activity; (iii) investing in training and process design; and (iv) investing in data and technology to enable improved transaction monitoring and data analytics capabilities. The Bank has established a dedicated program management infrastructure to monitor execution against the remediation program. This work is being overseen by an Interim AML/BSA Committee of the U.S. subsidiary boards and is expected to be a multi-year endeavour, involving additional investments. b) Restructuring Charges The Bank continued to undertake certain measures in the third quarter of 2024 to reduce its cost base and achieve greater efficiency. In connection with these measures, the Bank incurred $110 million and $566 million, respectively, of restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, which primarily relate to employee severance and other personnel-related costs and real estate optimization. The restructuring program has concluded. c) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment On November 16, 2023, the FDIC announced a final rule that implements a special assessment to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors during the U.S. bank failures in the spring of 2023. The special assessment resulted in the recognition of $411 million (US$300 million) pre-tax in non-interest expenses in the first quarter of the Bank’s fiscal 2024. On February 23, 2024, the FDIC notified all institutions subject to the special assessment that its estimate of total losses increased compared to the amount communicated with the final rule in November 2023. Accordingly, the Bank recognized an additional expense for the special assessment of $103 million (US$75 million) in the second quarter of the Bank’s fiscal 2024. The final amount of the Bank’s special assessment may be further updated as the FDIC determines the actual losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. d) Sale of Schwab Common Shares On August 21, 2024, the Bank announced that it had sold 40.5 million shares of common stock of Schwab. The shares are sold for proceeds of approximately $3.4 billion (US$2.5 billion). The share sale will reduce the Bank’s ownership interest in Schwab from 12.3% to 10.1%. The Bank is expected to recognize approximately $1.0 billion (US$0.7 billion) as other income (net of $0.5 billion (US$0.4 billion) loss from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) reclassified to earnings), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”). TD is the sixth largest bank in North America by assets and serves more than 27.5 million customers in four key businesses operating in a number of locations in financial centres around the globe: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, including TD Canada Trust and TD Auto Finance Canada; U.S. Retail, including TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank®, TD Auto Finance U.S., TD Wealth (U.S.), and an investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation; Wealth Management and Insurance, including TD Wealth (Canada), TD Direct Investing, and TD Insurance; and Wholesale Banking, including TD Securities and TD Cowen. TD also ranks among the world’s leading online financial services firms, with more than 17 million active online and mobile customers. TD had $1.97 trillion in assets on July 31, 2024. The Toronto Dominion Bank trades under the symbol “TD” on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges. The Bank prepares its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS and refers to results prepared in accordance with IFRS as “reported” results. Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures In addition to reported results, the Bank also presents certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures that are historical, non-GAAP ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures, to assess its results. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as “adjusted” results, are utilized to assess the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note” from reported results. Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP ratios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, net of ISE, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the Bank’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. Supplementary financial measures depict the Bank’s financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the Bank’s capital position, and both are explained in this document where they first appear. U.S. Strategic Cards The Bank’s U.S. strategic cards portfolio is comprised of agreements with certain U.S. retailers pursuant to which TD is the U.S. issuer of private label and co branded consumer credit cards to their U.S. customers. Under the terms of the individual agreements, the Bank and the retailers share in the profits generated by the relevant portfolios after credit losses. Under IFRS, TD is required to present the gross amount of revenue and PCL related to these portfolios in the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Statement of Income. At the segment level, the retailer program partners’ share of revenues and credit losses is presented in the Corporate segment, with an offsetting amount (representing the partners’ net share) recorded in Non-interest expenses, resulting in no impact to Corporate’s reported net income (loss). The net income (loss) included in the U.S. Retail segment includes only the portion of revenue and credit losses attributable to TD under the agreements."

        "page_content": "- Page 7 Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation and IDA Agreement On October 6, 2020, the Bank acquired an approximately 13.5% stake in The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) following the completion of Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (“TD Ameritrade”) of which the Bank was a major shareholder (the “Schwab transaction”). On August 1, 2022, the Bank sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Schwab, which reduced the Bank’s ownership interest in Schwab to approximately 12.0%. The Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The U.S. Retail segment reflects the Bank’s share of net income from its investment in Schwab. The Corporate segment net income (loss) includes amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles, the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction, and the Bank’s share of restructuring and other charges incurred by Schwab. The Bank’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. For further details, refer to Note 7 of the Bank’s third quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. On November 25, 2019, the Bank and Schwab signed an insured deposit account agreement (the “2019 Schwab IDA Agreement”), with an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. Under the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into an amended insured deposit account agreement (the “2023 Schwab IDA Agreement”), which replaced the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement. Pursuant to the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank continues to make sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Schwab designates a portion of the deposits with the Bank as fixed-rate obligation amounts (FROA). Remaining deposits over FROA are designated as floating rate obligations. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by three years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until September 2025, the aggregate FROA will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to $6.8 billion (US$5 billion) of FROA by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to certain limits. Refer to the “Related Party Transactions” section in the 2023 MD&A for further details. During the first quarter of 2024, Schwab exercised its option to buy down the remaining $0.7 billion (US$0.5 billion) of the US$5 billion FROA buydown allowance and paid $32 million (US$23 million) in termination fees to the Bank in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement. By the end of the first quarter of 2024, Schwab had completed its buy down of the full US$5 billion FROA buydown allowance and had paid a total of $337 million (US$250 million) in termination fees to the Bank. The fees were intended to compensate the Bank for losses incurred from discontinuing certain hedging relationships and for lost revenues. The net impact was recorded in net interest income.

The consolidated Bank adjusted ROE is calculated as adjusted net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. Adjusted ROE is a non-GAAP financial ratio and can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III.

By segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects increases in U.S. Retail of $4,471 million, in Wholesale Banking of $921 million, in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $247 million, and in Wealth Management and Insurance of $227 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Corporate segment of $650 million. The Bank’s reported efficiency ratio was 65.8%, compared with 59.3% in the same period last year. The Bank’s adjusted efficiency ratio, net of ISE was 56.9%, compared with 55.6% in the same period last year. Income Taxes The Bank’s effective income tax rate on a reported basis was 187.7% for the current quarter, compared with 20.7% in the third quarter last year and 23.5% in the prior quarter. The high rate in the current quarter reflects the tax impact of the non-deductible provision for investigations related to the Bank’s AML program. To allow for an after-tax calculation of adjusted income, the adjusted provision for income taxes is calculated by adjusting the taxes for each item of note using the statutory income tax rate of the applicable legal entity. The adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes as a percentage of adjusted net income before taxes. The Bank’s adjusted effective income tax rate was 20.2% for the current quarter, compared with 19.8% in the third quarter last year and 20.5% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects lower tax exempt dividend income in the current quarter and the recognition of historical tax losses at a higher Canadian tax rate in the prior year. The quarter over quarter change primarily reflects earnings mix.

Canadian Tax Measures Bill C-59 was substantively enacted on May 28, 2024 and received royal assent on June 20, 2024. The legislation advances certain tax measures originally introduced in the Canadian Federal budget presented on March 28, 2023. In particular, Bill C-59 denies the dividend received deduction in respect of dividends received by certain financial institutions on shares that are mark-to-market property, subject to a minor carve out for dividends on certain preferred shares, as well as imposes a 2% tax on the net value of share repurchases by public corporations in Canada. These measures are effective and have been implemented by the Bank as of January 1, 2024. International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Global Minimum Tax The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two model rules as part of its efforts toward international tax reform. The Pillar Two model rules provide for the implementation of a 15% global minimum tax for large multinational enterprises, which is to be applied on a jurisdiction-by jurisdiction basis. Pillar Two legislation was enacted in Canada on June 20, 2024 under Bill C-69, which includes the Global Minimum Tax Act addressing the Pillar Two model rules. The rules will be effective for the Bank for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2024. Similar legislation has also passed in other jurisdictions in which the Bank operates. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of the new legislation. TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

        "page_content": "- Page 14 The global economy remains on track to slow modestly in calendar 2024, reflecting the impact of past interest rate increases. Inflation across the G-7 has cooled as a result, and many central banks have started to lower interest rates. However, TD Economics expects future interest rate reductions to be gradual, with central banks vigilant on inflation risks. In addition, the evolution of geopolitical risks maintains a degree of uncertainty on both the economic outlook and the inflation trajectory. The U.S. economy has downshifted from a rapid 4% annualized pace of growth in the second half of calendar 2023 to a solid 2% pace in the first half of 2024. Slower growth is largely a result of cooler consumer spending, as elevated borrowing costs and slower growth in real income pinch consumers. In contrast, business investment has gained momentum through the first half of calendar 2024. Based on the July 2024 data, a softening U.S. job market has lifted the unemployment rate to 4.3%. However, this can still be characterized as a normalization following tight conditions that persisted for longer than expected after the pandemic. So far, the U.S. economy carries the markings of a “soft landing” that is allowing inflation pressures to gradually drift lower, which should pave the way for interest rate cuts in September. TD Economics expects the U.S. Federal Reserve will lower interest rates from the current restrictive level of 5.25-5.50% to 4.50-4.75% by the end of calendar 2024. This means that interest rates are still expected to weigh on demand through the year. In contrast, Canada’s economy had slowed notably in calendar 2023, but strong population growth has lifted economic growth in the first half of 2024. Strong population growth has also contributed to labour force growth outpacing job creation, taking the unemployment rate higher and cooling labour market conditions. The unemployment rate was 6.4% in July, above its pre-pandemic level, but still below its long-run average. TD Economics expects economic momentum to pick up in the second half of the year boosted by demographics and lower interest rates, but to remain modest overall. As a result of favourable inflation dynamics alongside a softening economy, the Bank of Canada has cut interest rates twice, taking the overnight rate to 4.50% in July. TD Economics expects the Bank of Canada to lower interest rates gradually, to 3.75% by the end of calendar 2024. With interest rates differentials between Canada and the U.S. holding roughly steady, TD Economics expects the Canadian dollar will hover in the 72 to 76 U.S. cent range over the next few quarters. For management reporting purposes, the Bank’s business operations and activities are organized around the following four key business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The Bank’s other activities are grouped into the Corporate segment. Results of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the Bank measures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments, the Bank indicates that the measure is adjusted. For further details, refer to the “How We Performed” section of this document, the “Business Focus” section in the Bank’s 2023 MD&A, and Note 28 of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2023. Effective the first quarter of 2024, certain asset management businesses which were previously reported in the U.S. Retail segment are now reported in the Wealth Management and Insurance segment. Comparative period information has been adjusted to reflect the new alignment. PCL related to performing (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and impaired (Stage 3) financial assets, loan commitments, and financial guarantees is recorded within the respective segment. Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt income, including certain dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent pre-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking results is reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the quarter was $27 million, compared with $4 million in the prior quarter and $40 million in the third quarter last year.

Insurance service expenses for the quarter were $1,669 million, an increase of $283 million, or 20%, compared with the third quarter last year, primarily reflecting increased claims severity, less favourable prior years’ claims development and larger impact of severe weather-related events. Non-interest expenses for the quarter were $1,104 million, an increase of $125 million, or 13%, compared with the third quarter last year, reflecting provisions related to ongoing litigation matters and higher variable compensation. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 33.0%, compared with 33.1% in the third quarter last year. The efficiency ratio, net of ISE for the quarter was 65.7%, compared with 62.3% in the third quarter last year. Quarterly comparison – Q3 2024 vs. Q2 2024 Wealth Management and Insurance net income for the quarter was $430 million, a decrease of $191 million, or 31%, compared with the prior quarter, primarily reflecting higher insurance service expenses and non-interest expenses, partially offset by higher revenue. The annualized ROE for the quarter was 27.1%, compared with 40.8% in the prior quarter. Revenue increased $235 million, or 8%, compared with the prior quarter. Non-interest income increased $223 million, or 8%, reflecting seasonally higher insurance premiums and higher fee-based revenue. Net interest income increased $12 million, or 4%, reflecting higher deposit margins. AUA increased $36 billion, or 6%, and AUM increased $34 billion, or 7%, compared with the prior quarter, both reflecting market appreciation and net asset growth. Insurance service expenses for the quarter increased $421 million, or 34%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting more severe weather-related events, increased claims severity, seasonally higher claims, and less favourable prior years’ claims development.

Refer to Note 2 of the Bank’s third quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Total assets were $1,967 billion as at July 31, 2024, an increase of $12 billion, from October 31, 2023. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the appreciation in the Canadian dollar decreased total assets by $5 billion. The increase in total assets reflects an increase in loans, net of allowances for loan losses of $42 billion, trading loans, securities, and other of $21 billion, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements of $9 billion, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income of $6 billion and investment in Schwab of $1 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in debt securities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses of $27 billion, derivative assets of $17 billion, other assets of $15 billion, cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $6 billion and non-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss of $2 billion. Cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks decreased $6 billion primarily reflecting cash management activities. Trading loans, securities, and other increased $21 billion primarily in equity securities, securitized mortgages and commodities held for trading, partially offset by government securities held for trading. Non-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss decreased $2 billion reflecting maturities and sales. Derivative assets decreased $17 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income increased $6 billion primarily reflecting new investments, partially offset by maturities and sales. Debt securities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses decreased $27 billion primarily reflecting maturities and sales and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by new investments and the impact of risk management activities. Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements increased $9 billion primarily reflecting an increase in volume, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased $42 billion primarily reflecting volume growth in business and government loans, including the transition of bankers’ acceptances to business and government loans following the cessation of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), and volume growth in residential real estate secured lending, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Investment in Schwab increased $1 billion primarily reflecting the impact of the Bank’s share of Schwab’s other comprehensive income. Other assets decreased $15 billion primarily reflecting a volume decrease in customers’ liabilities under acceptances as a result of the transition to business and government loans following the cessation of CDOR, partially offset by an increase in amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients due to higher volumes of pending trades.

        "page_content": "Page 23 Total liabilities were $1,856 billion as at July 31, 2024, an increase of $13 billion from October 31, 2023. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the appreciation in the Canadian dollar decreased total liabilities by $5 billion. The increase in total liabilities reflects an increase in deposits of $22 billion, obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements of $16 billion, financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss of $4 billion and trading deposits of $1 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in other liabilities of $19 billion and derivative liabilities of $11 billion Trading deposits increased $1 billion primarily reflecting new issuances. Derivative liabilities decreased $11 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss increased $4 billion reflecting issuances, partially offset by maturities. Deposits increased $22 billion primarily reflecting a volume increase in business and government and personal deposits, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $16 billion primarily reflecting an increase in volume. Other liabilities decreased $19 billion primarily reflecting a volume decrease in acceptances due to the cessation of CDOR, amounts payable to brokers, dealers, and clients and obligations related to securities sold short, partially offset by a volume increase in securitization liabilities at fair value, liabilities related to structured entities, and increase in provision for investigations related to the Bank’s AML program. Equity was $112 billion as at July 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, reflecting an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, offset by lower retained earnings. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income is primarily driven by gains on cash flow hedges and the Bank’s share of the other comprehensive income from investment in Schwab. The retained earnings decreased primarily from dividends paid and the premium on the repurchase of common shares, partially offset by net income. Quarterly comparison – Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023 Gross impaired loans excluding acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans were $4,170 million as at July 31, 2024, an increase of $1,190 million, or 40%, compared with the third quarter last year. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking gross impaired loans increased $367 million, or 28%, compared with the third quarter last year, reflecting formations outpacing resolutions in the commercial and consumer lending portfolios. U.S. Retail gross impaired loans increased $689 million, or 44%, compared with the third quarter last year, reflecting formations outpacing resolutions in the commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and the impact of foreign exchange. Wholesale gross impaired loans increased $133 million, compared with the third quarter last year, largely related to a few new formations in the current quarter, across various industries. Net impaired loans were $2,905 million as at July 31, 2024, an increase of $909 million, or 46%, compared with the third quarter last year. The allowance for credit losses of $8,838 million as at July 31, 2024 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $1,278 million, Stage 2 allowance of $4,647 million and Stage 1 allowance of $2,909 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $4 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $289 million, or 29%, reflective of credit migration in the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, Wholesale, and U.S. consumer lending portfolios, and the impact of foreign exchange. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses increased $773 million, or 11%, reflecting current credit conditions, including credit migration, volume growth, and the impact of foreign exchange. The allowance change included an increase of $96 million attributable to the retailer program partners’ share of the U.S. strategic cards portfolio. The allowance for debt securities increased by $2 million, compared with the third quarter last year. Forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables deemed to be predictive of expected credit losses (ECLs) based on the Bank’s experience, is used to determine ECL scenarios and associated probability weights to determine the probability-weighted ECLs. Each quarter, all base forecast macroeconomic variables are refreshed, resulting in new upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios. The probability weightings assigned to each ECL scenario are also reviewed each quarter and updated as required, as part of the Bank’s ECL governance process. As a result of periodic reviews and quarterly updates, the allowance for credit losses may be revised to reflect updates in loss estimates based on the Bank’s recent loss experience and its forward-looking views. The Bank periodically reviews the methodology and has performed certain additional quantitative and qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s third quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on forward-looking information. The probability-weighted allowance for credit losses reflects the Bank’s forward-looking views. To the extent that certain anticipated effects cannot be fully incorporated into quantitative models, management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in determining the amount of ECLs. The allowance for credit losses will be updated in future quarters as additional information becomes available. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s third quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Bank calculates allowances for ECLs on debt securities measured at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Bank has $354 billion in such debt securities, all of which are performing (Stage 1 and 2) and none are impaired (Stage 3). The allowance for credit losses on debt securities at amortized cost (DSAC) and debt securities at FVOCI was $3 million and $1 million, respectively. Quarterly comparison – Q3 2024 vs. Q2 2024 Gross impaired loans increased $275 million, or 7%, compared with the prior quarter, largely related to new formations outpacing resolutions in the Wholesale and U.S. Commercial lending portfolios. Impaired loans net of allowance increased $161 million, or 6%, compared with the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses of $8,838 million as at July 31, 2024 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $1,278 million, Stage 2 allowance of $4,647 million and Stage 1 allowance of $2,909 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $4 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $116 million, or 10%, compared with the prior quarter, largely driven by credit migration in the Wholesale lending portfolio. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses increased $171 million, or 2%, compared with the prior quarter. The allowance for debt securities increased by $1 million, compared to the prior quarter. TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

Real Estate Secured Lending Retail real estate secured lending includes mortgages and lines of credit to North American consumers to satisfy financing needs including home purchases and refinancing. While the Bank retains first lien on the majority of properties held as security, there is a small portion of loans with second liens, but most of these are behind a TD mortgage that is in first position. In Canada, credit policies are designed so that the combined exposure of all uninsured facilities on one property does not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination. Lending at a higher loan-to-value ratio is permitted by legislation but requires default insurance. This insurance is contractual coverage for the life of eligible facilities and protects the Bank’s real estate secured lending portfolio against potential losses caused by borrowers’ default. The Bank may also purchase default insurance on lower loan-to-value ratio loans. The insurance is provided by either government-backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers. In the U.S., for residential mortgage originations, mortgage insurance is usually obtained from either government backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers when the loan-to-value exceeds 80% of the collateral value at origination. The Bank regularly performs stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio as part of its overall stress testing program. This is done with a view to determine the extent to which the portfolio would be vulnerable to a severe downturn in economic conditions. The effect of severe changes in house prices, interest rates, and unemployment levels are among the factors considered when assessing the impact on credit losses and the Bank’s overall profitability. A variety of portfolio segments, including dwelling type and geographical regions, are examined during the exercise to determine whether specific vulnerabilities exist.

The following table provides a summary of the period over which the Bank’s residential mortgages would be fully repaid based on the amount of the most recent payment received. All figures are calculated based on current customer payment amounts, including voluntary payments larger than the original contractual amounts and/or other voluntary prepayments. The most recent customer payment amount may exceed the original contractual amount due. Balances with a remaining amortization longer than 30 years primarily reflect Canadian variable rate mortgages where interest rate increases relative to current customer payment levels have resulted in a longer current amortization period. At renewal, the amortization period for Canadian mortgages reverts to the remaining contractual amortization, which may require increased payments.

In 2015, Basel III introduced a non-risk sensitive leverage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage exposure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. TD manages its regulatory capital in accordance with OSFI’s implementation of the Basel III Capital Framework. OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III OSFI’s CAR and LR guidelines detail how the Basel III capital rules apply to Canadian banks. The Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) level was increased to 3.5% as of November 1, 2023. The 50 bps increase from the previous level of 3% reflects OSFI’s view of appropriate actions to enhance the resilience of Canada’s largest banks against vulnerabilities. The current DSB range is 0 to 4% and the DSB level may change in response to developments in Canada’s financial system and the broader economic environment. On February 1, 2023, OSFI implemented revised capital rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. These revised rules include revisions to the calculation of credit risk and operational risk requirements, and revisions to the LR Guideline to include a requirement for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the regulatory minimum requirement of 3.0%. This buffer will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio. On November 1, 2023, the Bank implemented OSFI’s Parental Stand-Alone (Solo) Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Framework for D-SIBs, which establishes a risk-based measure intended to ensure a non-viable D-SIB has sufficient loss absorbing capacity on a stand-alone, legal entity basis to support its resolution. The Bank is compliant with the requirements set out in this new framework. The table below summarizes OSFI’s current regulatory minimum capital targets for the Bank as at July 31, 2024. inimum Capital Conservation Buffer D-SIB / G-SIB Surcharge1 Pillar 1 Regulatory Target2 DSB Pillar 1 & 2 Regulatory Target CET1 4.5 % 2.5 % 1.0 % 8.0 % 3.5 % 11.5 % Tier 1 6.0 2.5 1.0 9.5 3.5 13.0 Total Capital 8.0 2.5 1.0 11.5 3.5 15.0 Leverage 3.0 n/a3 0.5 3.5 n/a 3.5 TLAC 18.0 2.5 1.0 21.5 3.5 25.0 TLAC Leverage 6.75 n/a 0.50 7.25 n/a 7.25 1 The higher of the D-SIB and Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) surcharge applies to risk weighted capital. The D- SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the Bank’s 1% G-SIB additional common equity requirement for risk weighted capital. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%. OSFI’s Leverage Requirements Guideline includes a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer set at 50% of a D-SIB’s higher loss absorbency risk-weighted requirements, effectively 0.50%. This buffer also applies to the TLAC Leverage ratio. 2 The Bank’s countercyclical buffer requirement is 0% as of July 31, 2024. 3 Not applicable.

The impact to CET1 capital upon adoption of IFRS 17 is immaterial to the Bank. As at July 31, 2024, the Bank’s CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios were 12.8%, 14.6%, and 16.3%, respectively. The decrease in the Bank’s CET1 Capital ratio from 14.4% as at October 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to the provision for investigations related to the Bank’s AML program, common shares repurchased for cancellation, and RWA growth across various segments. CET1 was also impacted by regulatory changes related to the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book and Negatively amortizing mortgages and the FDIC special assessment booked in the fiscal year. The impact of the foregoing items was partially offset by internal capital generation, the sale of TD’s common share holdings in First Horizon, and the issuance of common shares pursuant to the Bank’s dividend reinvestment plan.

The LRCNs will bear interest at a rate of 7.250 per cent annually, payable quarterly, for the initial period ending on, but excluding, July 31, 2029. Thereafter, the interest rate on the LRCNs will reset every five years at a rate equal to the prevailing U.S. Treasury Rate plus 2.977 per cent. The LRCNs will mature on July 31, 2084. Concurrently with the issuance of the LRCNs, the Bank will issue 750,000 Non-Cumulative 7.250% Fixed Rate Reset Preferred Shares, Series 31 NVCC (“Preferred Shares Series 31”). The Preferred Shares Series 31 are eliminated on the Bank’s consolidated financial statements. 9 On July 10, 2024, the Bank issued SGD 310 million of Fixed Rate Reset Perpetual Subordinated Additional Tier 1 Capital Notes, Series 2023-9 NVCC (the “AT1 Perpetual Notes”). The AT1 Perpetual Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.700 per cent annually, payable semi-annually, for the initial period ending on, but excluding, July 31, 2029. Thereafter, the interest rate on the AT1 Perpetual Notes will reset every five years at a rate equal to the prevailing 5-year SORA-OIS Rate plus 2.652 per cent. The AT1 Perpetual Notes have no scheduled maturity or redemption date. With the prior written approval of OSFI, the Bank may redeem the AT1 Perpetual Notes on July 31, 2029 and every January 31st and July 31st thereafter, in whole or in part, on not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to holders. For AT1 Perpetual Notes, the amount represents the Canadian dollar equivalent of the Singapore dollar notional amount. On August 21, 2024, the Board approved a dividend in an amount of one dollar and two cents ($1.02) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the Bank for the quarter ending October 31, 2024, payable on and after October 31, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 10, 2024. The Bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan for its common shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on common shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion or purchased from the open market at market price. During the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, the Bank issued 1.6 million and 4.9 million common shares, respectively, from treasury with no discount. During the three months ended July 31, 2023, the Bank issued 2.0 million common shares from treasury with no discount and during the nine months ended July 31, 2023 the Bank issued 2.0 million common shares from treasury with no discount and 16.8 million common shares from treasury with a 2% discount.

The NCIB commenced on August 31, 2023, and during the three months ended July 31, 2024, the Bank repurchased 13.3 million common shares under the NCIB at an average price of $76.68 per share for a total amount of $1.0 billion. During the nine months ended July 31, 2024, the Bank repurchased 49.4 million common shares under the NCIB, at an average price of $80.15 per share for a total amount of $4.0 billion. From the commencement of the NCIB to July 31, 2024, the Bank repurchased 71.4 million shares under the program. NON-VIABILITY CONTINGENT CAPITAL PROVISION If an NVCC trigger event were to occur, for all series of Class A First Preferred Shares excluding the preferred shares issued with respect to LRCNs, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the respective series of preferred shares at the time of conversion, would be 0.8 billion in aggregate. The LRCNs, by virtue of the recourse to the preferred shares held in the Limited Recourse Trust, include NVCC provisions. For LRCNs, if an NVCC trigger were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares series issued in connection with such LRCNs, would be 1.3 billion in aggregate. For all other NVCC subordinated notes and debentures including Additional Tier 1 Perpetual Notes, if an NVCC trigger event were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there is no accrued and unpaid interest on the respective subordinated notes and debentures, would be 3.5 billion in aggregate. Growing profitability in financial results based on balanced revenue, expense and capital growth services involves selectively taking and managing risks within the Bank’s risk appetite. The Bank’s goal is to earn a stable and sustainable rate of return for every dollar of risk it takes, while putting significant emphasis on investing in its businesses to meet its future strategic objectives. The Bank’s businesses and operations are exposed to a broad number of risks that have been identified and defined in the Enterprise Risk Framework. The Bank’s tolerance to those risks is defined in the Enterprise Risk Appetite which has been developed within a comprehensive framework that takes into consideration current conditions in which the Bank operates and the impact that emerging risks will have on TD’s strategy and risk profile. The Bank’s risk appetite states that it takes risks required to build its business, but only if those risks: (1) fit the business strategy and can be understood and managed; (2) do not expose the enterprise to any significant single loss events; TD does not ‘bet the bank’ on any single acquisition, business, or product; and (3) do not risk harming the TD brand. Each business is responsible for setting and aligning its individual risk appetites with that of the enterprise based on a thorough examination of the specific risks to which it is exposed. The Bank considers it critical to regularly assess its operating environment and highlight top and emerging risks. These are risks with a potential to have a material effect on the Bank and where the attention of senior leaders is focused due to the potential magnitude or immediacy of their impact. Risks are identified, discussed, and actioned by senior leaders and reported quarterly to the Risk Committee. Specific plans to mitigate top and emerging risks are prepared, monitored, and adjusted as required. The Bank’s risk governance structure and risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report. Additional information on risk factors can be found in this document and the 2023 MD&A under the heading “Risk Factors and Management”. For a complete discussion of the risk governance structure and the risk management approach, refer to the “Managing Risk” section in the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report. The shaded sections of this MD&A represent a discussion relating to market and liquidity risks and form an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended July 31, 2024. Gross credit risk exposure, also referred to as exposure at default (EAD), is the total amount the Bank is exposed to at the time of default of a loan and is measured before counterparty-specific provisions or write-offs. Gross credit risk exposure does not reflect the effects of credit risk mitigation (CRM) and includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. On-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of outstanding loans, non-trading securities, derivatives, and certain other repo-style transactions. Off-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of undrawn commitments, guarantees, and certain other repo-style transactions. Gross credit risk exposures for the two approaches the Bank uses to measure credit risk are included in the following table.

        "page_content": "Page 31 Calculating VaR The Bank computes total VaR on a daily basis by combining the General Market Risk (GMR) and Idiosyncratic Debt Specific Risk (IDSR) associated with the Bank’s trading positions. GMR is determined by creating a distribution of potential changes in the market value of the current portfolio using historical simulation. The Bank values the current portfolio using the market price and rate changes of the most recent 259 trading days for equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity products. GMR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. A one-day holding period is used for GMR calculation. IDSR measures idiosyncratic (single-name) credit spread risk for credit exposures in the trading portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. The IDSR model is based on the historical behaviour of five-year idiosyncratic credit spreads. Similar to GMR, IDSR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. IDSR is measured for a ten-day holding period. VaR is a valuable risk measure but it should be used in the context of its limitations, for example: • VaR uses historical data to estimate future events, which limits its forecasting abilities; • it does not provide information on losses beyond the selected confidence level; and • it assumes that all positions can be liquidated during the holding period used for VaR calculation. The Bank continuously improves its VaR methodologies and incorporates new risk measures in line with market conventions, industry best practices, and regulatory requirements. To mitigate some of the shortcomings of VaR, the Bank uses additional metrics designed for risk management purposes. This includes Stress Testing as well as sensitivities to various market risk factors. The following table presents the end of quarter, average, high, and low usage of TD’s VaR metric.

It is not meaningful to compute a diversification effect because the high and low may occur on different days for different risk types. Average VaR increased quarter-over-quarter due to changes in fixed income positions. Average VaR decreased year-over-year due to changes in interest rate positions and due to narrower credit spreads. The following graph discloses daily one-day VaR usage and trading net revenue, reported on a TEB, within Wholesale Banking. Trading net revenue includes trading income and net interest income related to positions within the Bank’s market risk capital trading books. For the quarter ended July 31, 2024, there were 3 days of trading losses and trading net revenue was positive for 95% of the trading days, reflecting normal trading activity. Losses in the year did not exceed VaR on any trading day. - 70 -60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 5/1/2024 5/8/2024 5/15/20245/22/2024 5/29/2024 6/5/2024 6/12/2024 6/19/2024 6/26/2024 7/3/2024 7/10/2024 7/17/2024 7/24/2024 7/31/2024 TOTAL VALUE-AT-RISK AND TRADING NET REVENUE (millions of Canadian dollars) Trading net revenue Value-at-Risk TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

        "page_content": "- Page 32 Validation of VaR Model The Bank uses a back-testing process to compare actual profits and losses to VaR to review their consistency with the statistical results of the VaR model. Structural (Non-Trading) Interest Rate Risk The Bank’s structural interest rate risk arises from traditional personal and commercial banking activity and is generally the result of mismatches between the maturities and repricing dates of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. The measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book does not include exposures from TD’s Wholesale Banking or Insurance businesses. The primary measures for this risk are Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS). The EVE Sensitivity measures the impact of a specified interest rate shock to the change in the net present value of the Bank’s banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items. It reflects a measurement of the potential present value impact on shareholders’ equity without an assumed term profile for the management of the Bank’s own equity and excludes product margins. The NIIS measures the NII change over a twelve-month horizon for a specified change in interest rates for banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off balance sheet items assuming a constant balance sheet over the period. The Bank’s Market Risk policy sets overall limits on the structural interest rate risk measures. These limits are periodically reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee. In addition to the Board policy limits, book-level risk limits are set for the Bank’s management of non-trading interest rate risk by Risk Management. Exposures against these limits are routinely monitored and reported, and breaches of the Board limits, if any, are escalated to both the Asset/Liability and Capital Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee. The following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rates on the EVE and NIIS measures. TABLE 30: STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY MEASURES (millions of Canadian dollars) As at July 31, 2024 April 30, 2024 July 31, 2023 Sensitivity Sensitivity1 Sensitivity Sensitivity1 Sensitivity Sensitivity1 Canada U.S. T otal Canada U.S. Total Total Total Total Total Before-tax impact of 100 bps increase in rates $ (605) $ (1,880) $ (2,485) $ 439 $ 346 $ 785 $ (2,312) $ 875 $ (1,415) $ 984 100 bps decrease in rates 472 1,420 1,892 (475) (602) (1,077) 1,861 (1,053) 1,003 (1,155) 1 Represents the twelve-month net interest income (NII) exposure to an immediate and sustained shock in rates . As at July 31, 2024, an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase in interest rates would have had a negative impact to the Bank’s EVE of $2,485 million, an increase of $173 million from last quarter, and a positive impact to the Bank’s NII of $785 million, a decrease of $90 million from last quarter. An immediate and sustained 100 bps decrease in interest rates would have had a positive impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,892 million, an increase of $31 million from last quarter, and a negative impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,077 million, an increase of $24 million from last quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in EVE Sensitivity is primarily attributed to growth in fixed rate assets funded by equity, mainly in Canada. The quarter-over-quarter NII Sensitivity is relatively stable. TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

        "page_content": "Page 33 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient cash or collateral to meet financial obligations and an inability to, in a timely manner, raise funding or monetize assets at a non-distressed price. Financial obligations can arise from deposit withdrawals, debt maturities, commitments to provide credit or liquidity support, or the need to pledge additional collateral. TD’S LIQUIDITY RISK APPETITE The Bank applies an established set of practices and protocols for managing its potential exposure to liquidity risk. The Bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under a combined bank-specific and market-wide stress scenario, and a minimum buffer over regulatory requirements prescribed by the OSFI Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) guidelines. The Bank’s funding program emphasizes maximizing deposits as a core source of funding and maintaining access to wholesale funding markets across diversified terms, counterparties, funding types, and currencies that is designed to ensure low exposure to a sudden contraction of wholesale funding capacity and to minimize structural liquidity gaps. The Bank also maintains a contingency funding plan to enhance preparedness for recovery from potential liquidity stress events. The Bank’s strategies and actions comprise an integrated liquidity risk management program that is designed to ensure low exposure to liquidity risk and compliance with regulatory requirements. The Bank’s ALCO oversees the Bank’s liquidity risk management program. It ensures there are effective management structures and practices in place to properly measure and manage liquidity risk. The Global Liquidity & Funding Committee, a subcommittee of the ALCO comprised of senior management from Treasury, Risk Management and Wholesale Banking, identifies and monitors the Bank’s liquidity risks. The management of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the SET member responsible for Treasury, while oversight and challenge are provided by the ALCO and independently by Risk Management. The Risk Committee regularly reviews the Bank’s liquidity position and approves the Bank’s Liquidity Risk Management Framework biennially and the related policies annually. The Bank’s liquidity risk appetite and liquidity risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report. For a complete discussion of liquidity risk, refer to the “Liquidity Risk” section in the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report. Liquid assets The unencumbered liquid assets the Bank holds to meet its liquidity requirements must be high-quality securities that the Bank believes can be monetized quickly in stress conditions with minimal loss in market value. The liquidity value of unencumbered liquid assets considers estimated market or trading depths, settlement timing, and/or other identified impediments to potential sale or pledging. Assets held by the Bank to meet liquidity requirements are summarized in the following tables. The tables do not include assets held within the Bank’s insurance businesses as these are used to support insurance-specific liabilities and capital requirements.

Where a particular asset has been encumbered and TD has hol dings of the asset both on-balance sheet and off balance sheet, for the purpose of this disclosure, the on- and off-balance sheet holdings are encumbered in alignment with the business practice. 2 Assets received as collateral through off-balance sheet transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, margin loans, and other client activity. 3 Represents assets that have been posted externally to support the Bank’s day-to-day operations, including securities financing transactions, clearing and payments, and derivative transactions. Also includes assets that have been pledged supporting Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) activity. 4 Assets supporting TD’s long-term funding activities, assets pledged against securitization liabilities, and assets held by consolidated securitization ve hicles or in pools for covered bond issuance. 5 Assets that are considered readily available in their current legal form to generate funding or support collateral needs. This category includes re ported FHLB assets that remain unutilized and DSAC that are available for collateral purposes however not regularly utilized in pra ctice. 6 Assets that cannot be used to support funding or collateral requirements in their current form. This category includes those assets that are potentially eligible as funding program collateral or for pledging to central banks (for example, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation insured mortgages that can be securitized into NHA MBS ). 7 Includes trading loans, securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL and other financial assets designated at FVTPL, financial assets at FVOCI, and DSAC. 8 Assets reported in the “Bank-owned assets” column represent the value of the loans extended and not the value of the collateral received. The loan value from the revers e repurchase transactions is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double-counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 9 The loan value from the margin loans/client activity is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 10 Other assets include investment in Schwab, goodwill, other intangibles, land, buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets, deferred tax assets, amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, and other assets on the balance sheet not reported in the above categories. In addition to the Severe Combined Stress Scenario, the Bank performs liquidity stress testing on multiple alternate scenarios. These scenarios are a mix of TD specific events and market-wide stress events designed to test the impact from risk factors material to the Bank’s risk profile. Liquidity assessments are also part of the Bank’s Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing program. The Bank has liquidity contingency funding plans (CFP) in place at the overall Bank level and for certain subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions (Regional CFPs). The Bank’s CFP provides a documented framework for managing unexpected liquidity situations and thus is an integral component of the Bank’s overall liquidity risk management program. It outlines different contingency levels based on the severity and duration of the liquidity situation and identifies recovery actions appropriate for each level. For each recovery action, it provides key operational steps required to execute the action. Regional CFPs identify recovery actions to address region-specific stress events. The actions and governance structure outlined in the Bank’s CFP are aligned with the Bank’s Crisis Management Recovery Plan. Credit ratings impact the Bank’s borrowing costs and ability to raise funds. Rating downgrades could potentially result in higher financing costs, increased requirements to pledge collateral, reduced access to capital markets, and could also affect the Bank’s ability to enter into derivative transactions. Credit ratings and outlooks provided by rating agencies reflect their views and are subject to change from time to time, based on a number of factors including the Bank’s financial strength, competitive position, and liquidity, as well as factors not entirely within the Bank’s control, including the methodologies used by rating agencies and conditions affecting the overall financial services industry.

The NSFR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of total available stable funding (ASF) over total required stable funding (RSF) in accordance with OSFI’s LAR guideline. The Bank must maintain an NSFR ratio equal to or above 100% in accordance with the LAR guideline. The Bank’s ASF comprises the Bank’s liability and capital instruments (including deposits and wholesale funding). The assets that require stable funding are based on the Bank’s on and off-balance sheet activities and a function of their liquidity characteristics and the requirements of OSFI’s LAR guideline.

The Bank’s funding activities are conducted in accordance with liquidity risk management policies that require assets be funded to the appropriate term and to a prudent diversification profile. The Bank’s primary approach to managing funding activities is to maximize the use of deposits raised through personal and commercial banking channels. The following table illustrates the Bank’s base of personal and commercial, wealth, and Schwab sweep deposits (collectively, “P&C deposits”) that make up approximately 70% (October 31, 2023 – 70%) of the Bank’s total funding.

The Bank maintains various registered external wholesale term (greater than 1 year) funding programs to provide access to diversified funding sources, including asset securitization, covered bonds, and unsecured wholesale debt. The Bank raises term funding through Senior Notes, NHA MBS, and notes backed by credit card receivables (Evergreen Credit Card Trust) and home equity lines of credit (Genesis Trust II). The Bank’s wholesale funding is diversified by geography, by currency, and by funding types. The Bank raises short-term (1 year or less) funding using certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and bankers’ acceptances. The following table summarizes the registered term funding and capital programs by geography, with the related program size as at July 31, 2024.

MATURITY ANALYSIS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet categories by remaining contractual maturity. Off-balance sheet commitments include contractual obligations to make future payments on certain lease-related commitments, certain purchase obligations, and other liabilities. The values of credit instruments reported in the following table represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the Bank could be obligated to extend should such instruments be fully drawn or utilized. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contractual amounts is not representative of expected future liquidity requirements. These contractual obligations have an impact on the Bank’s short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The maturity analysis presented does not depict the degree of the Bank’s maturity transformation or the Bank’s exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk. The Bank’s objective is to fund its assets appropriately to protect against borrowing cost volatility and potential reductions to funding market availability. The Bank utilizes stable non-maturity deposits (chequing and savings accounts) and term deposits as the primary source of long-term funding for the Bank’s non-trading assets including personal and business term loans and the stable balance of revolving lines of credit. Additionally, the Bank issues long-term funding in respect of such non-trading assets and raises short term funding primarily to finance trading assets. The liquidity of trading assets under stressed market conditions is considered when determining the appropriate term of the funding. TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

        "page_content": "Page 44 REGULATORY AND STANDARD SETTER DEVELOPMENTS CONCERNING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL (E&S) RISK (INCLUDING CLIMATE) On March 7, 2023, OSFI issued Final Guideline B-15: Climate Risk Management (Guideline B-15), which sets out OSFI’s expectations related to the management and disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities. Subsequently, on March 20, 2024, OSFI released updates to Guideline B-15 which align disclosure expectations with the International Sustainability Standards Board’s final IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures standard. Components of Guideline B-15 are initially effective for D-SIBs for fiscal year-end 2024, where annual disclosures are required to be made publicly available no later than 180 days after fiscal year-end. The Bank has completed its initial assessment of Guideline B-15 and is working towards implementing the requirements. ISSB – IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 On June 26, 2023, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the IFRS Foundation, issued its first two sustainability standards, IFRS S1, General Requirements for Disclosures of Sustainability-related Financial Information (S1) and IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures (S2). S1 sets out the disclosure requirements for financially material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities to meet investor information needs, and S2 specifically sets the disclosure requirement for climate-related risks and opportunities. The effective date for the standards is subject to Canadian jurisdiction’s endorsement. The International Organization of Securities Commissions has endorsed IFRS S1 and S2 on July 23, 2023, and is now calling its member jurisdictions to consider ways they may adopt or apply the ISSB standards. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopting these standards. SECURITIZATION AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Bank enters into securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations. The Bank is involved with structured entities (SEs) that it sponsors, as well as entities sponsored by third parties. Refer to “Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section, Note 9: Transfers of Financial Assets and Note 10: Structured Entities of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report for further details. There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended July 31, 2024. Securitization of Third-Party Originated Assets Significant Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities The Bank securitizes third-party originated assets through Bank-sponsored SEs, including its Canadian multi-seller conduits which are not consolidated. These Canadian multi-seller conduits securitize Canadian originated third-party assets. The Bank administers these multi-seller conduits and provides liquidity facilities as well as securities distribution services; it may also provide credit enhancements. TD’s total potential exposure to loss through the provision of liquidity facilities for multi-seller conduits was $15.7 billion as at July 31, 2024 (October 31, 2023 – $15.2 billion). As at July 31, 2024, the Bank had funded exposure of $13.8 billion under such liquidity facilities relating to outstanding issuances of asset-backed commercial paper (October 31, 2023 – $13.3 billion). The Bank’s unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. For details of the Bank’s accounting policies under IFRS, refer to Note 2 of the Bank’s third quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. For details of the Bank’s significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions under IFRS, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s third quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. The following new standard has been adopted by the Bank on November 1, 2023. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) which replaced the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) and became effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which was November 1, 2023 for the Bank. IFRS 17 establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk-adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The liabilities presented by insurance groups are comprised of the liability for remaining coverage (LRC) and the liability for incurred claims (LIC) and are reported as Insurance contract liabilities on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet. The LRC is the obligation to investigate and pay claims that have not yet occurred and includes the loss component related to onerous contract groups. The LIC is the estimate of claims incurred, including claims that have occurred but have not been reported, and related insurance costs. IFRS 17 introduces two measurement models that are applicable to the Bank, the premium allocation approach model (PAA) and the general measurement model (GMM). The Bank measures the majority of its insurance contract groups using the PAA, which includes property and casualty contracts as well as short-term life and health contracts. The PAA is a simplified model applied to insurance contracts that are either one year or less or where the PAA approximates the GMM. Contracts using the GMM are longer-term life and health contracts. The LRC for insurance contract groups using the PAA is measured as unearned premiums less deferred acquisition cash flows allocated to the group. The LRC is adjusted for the recognition of insurance revenue and amortization of acquisition cash flows reported in insurance service expenses on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the underlying insurance contracts, usually twelve months. The LRC for longer term contracts using the GMM model is measured using estimates and assumptions that reflect the timing and uncertainty of insurance cash flows. When a group of contracts is expected to be onerous, a loss component (expected loss related to fulfilling the related insurance contracts) is established which increases the LRC and insurance service expenses. The loss component of the LRC is subsequently recognized in income over the contractual term of the underlying insurance contracts to offset claims incurred and related expenses. The Bank measures the LIC at the present value of current estimates of claims and related costs for insurable events occurring at or before the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet date. The LIC includes a risk adjustment, which represents the compensation the Bank requires for bearing the uncertainty related to non-financial risks in its fulfilment of insurance contracts. Expenses related to claims incurred and related costs are reported in insurance service expenses and changes related to discounting the liability are recorded as insurance finance income or expenses in other income (loss). Prior to the adoption of IFRS 17, these expenses were recorded in insurance claims and related expenses and non-interest expenses. TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

        "page_content": "Page 45 Reinsurance contracts held are recognized and measured using the same principles as insurance contracts issued. Reinsurance contract assets are presented in Other assets on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet and the net results from reinsurance contracts held are presented in Other income (loss) on the Interim Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 14 of the Bank’s third quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the balances and results of insurance and reinsurance contracts. The Bank initially applied IFRS 17 on November 1, 2023 and restated the comparative period. The Bank transitioned by primarily applying the full retrospective approach which resulted in the measurement of insurance contracts as if IFRS 17 had always applied to them. The following table sets out adjustments to the Bank’s insurance-related balances reported under IFRS 4 as at October 31, 2022 used to derive the insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance contract assets recognized by the Bank as at November 1, 2022 under IFRS 17.

Upon the initial application of IFRS 17 on November 1, 2023, the Bank applied transitional guidance and reclassified certain securities supporting insurance operations to minimize accounting mismatches arising from the application of the new discount factor under IFRS 17. The transitional guidance for such securities is applicable for entities that previously used IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) and was applied without a restatement of comparatives. The reclassification resulted in a decrease to retained earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $10 million. ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The ECL model requires the application of judgments, estimates, and assumptions in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. There remains elevated economic uncertainty, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. Insurance Contracts The assumptions used in establishing the Bank’s insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are based on best estimates of possible outcomes. For property and casualty insurance contracts, the ultimate cost of LIC is estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques in accordance with Canadian accepted actuarial practices. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in the future, in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate claims cost amounts that present the most likely outcome taking into account all the uncertainties involved. For life and health insurance contracts, actuarial liabilities consider all future policy cash flows, including premiums, claims, and expenses required to administer the policies. Critical assumptions used in the measurement of life and health insurance contract liabilities are determined by the appointed actuary. Further information on insurance risk assumptions is provided in Note 14 of the Bank’s third quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform As part of the interest rate benchmark reform, the remaining tenors of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) (one-month, two-month, and three-month) have ceased following a final publication on June 28, 2024. Consistent with its transition plan, the Bank’s exposure to financial instruments referencing CDOR is no longer significant to its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as at July 31, 2024. For further details regarding interest rate benchmark reform, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. The following standard and amendments have been issued, but are not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements In April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18), which replaces the guidance in IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements and sets out requirements for presentation and disclosure of information, focusing on providing relevant information to users of the financial statements. IFRS 18 focuses on the presentation of financial performance in the statement of profit or loss. It will be effective for the Bank’s annual period beginning November 1, 2027. Early application is permitted. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard. TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

        "page_content": "Page 46 mendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments In May 2024, the IASB issued Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments, which amended IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures. The amendments address matters identified during the post-implementation review of the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9. The amendments clarify how to assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets that include environmental, social, and governance linked features and other similar contingent features. The amendments also clarify the treatment of non-recourse assets and contractually linked instruments. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that a financial liability is derecognized on the settlement date and provide an accounting policy choice to derecognize a financial liability settled using an electronic payment system before the settlement date if certain conditions are met. Finally, the amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements for financial instruments with contingent features and equity instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The amendments will be effective for the Bank’s annual period beginning November 1, 2026. Early adoption is permitted, with an option to early adopt the amendments for contingent features only. The Bank is required to apply the amendments retrospectively, but is not required to restate prior periods. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopting these amendments. During the most recent interim period, there have been no changes in the Bank’s policies and procedures and other processes that comprise its internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 of the Bank’s third quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bank’s changes to accounting policies, procedures, and estimates.

        "page_content": "TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 47 Financial and Banking Terms Adjusted Results: Non-GAAP financial measures used to assess each of the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note”, from reported results. The items of note relate to items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance. Allowance for Credit Losses: Represent expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. Allowance for credit losses consists of Stage 3 allowance for impaired financial assets and Stage 2 and Stage 1 allowance for performing financial assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals, and impacted by foreign exchange. Amortized Cost: The amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization, using EIRM, of any differences between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. Assets under Administration (AUA): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers where the Bank provides services of an administrative nature, such as the collection of investment income and the placing of trades on behalf of the clients (where the client has made his or her own investment selection). The majority of these assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets under Management (AUM): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers, managed by the Bank, where the Bank has discretion to make investment selections on behalf of the client (in accordance with an investment policy). In addition to the TD family of mutual funds, the Bank manages assets on behalf of individuals, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments and foundations. These assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Some assets under management that are also administered by the Bank are included in assets under administration. Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP): A form of commercial paper that is collateralized by other financial assets. Institutional investors usually purchase such instruments in order to diversify their assets and generate short-term gains. Asset-Backed Securities (ABS): A security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or “backed”) by a specified pool of underlying assets. Average Common Equity: Average common equity for the business segments reflects the average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Average Interest-Earning Assets: A non-GAAP financial measure that depicts the Bank’s financial position, and is calculated as the average carrying value of deposits with banks, loans and securities based on daily balances for the period ending October 31 in each fiscal year. Basic Earnings per Share (EPS): A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted basic EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Basis Points (bps): A unit equal to 1/100 of 1%. Thus, a 1% change is equal to 100 basis points. Book Value per Share: A measure calculated by dividing common shareholders’ equity by number of common shares at the end of the period. Carrying Value: The value at which an asset or liability is carried at on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO): They are collateralized debt obligations consisting of mortgage-backed securities that are separated and issued as different classes of mortgage pass-through securities with different terms, interest rates, and risks. CMOs by private issuers are collectively referred to as non-agency CMOs. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: This is a primary Basel III capital measure comprised mainly of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. Regulatory deductions made to arrive at the CET1 Capital include goodwill and intangibles, unconsolidated investments in banking, financial, and insurance entities, deferred tax assets, defined benefit pension fund assets, and shortfalls in allowances. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio: CET1 Capital ratio represents the predominant measure of capital adequacy under Basel III and equals CET1 Capital divided by RWA. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): A measure of growth over multiple time periods from the initial investment value to the ending investment value assuming that the investment has been compounding over the time period. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA): CVA represents a capital charge that measures credit risk due to default of derivative counterparties. This charge requires banks to capitalize for the potential changes in counterparty credit spread for the derivative portfolios. Diluted EPS: A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusting for the effect of all potentially dilutive common shares. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Payout Ratio: A ratio represents the percentage of Bank’s earnings being paid to common shareholders in the form of dividends and is calculated by dividing common dividends by net income available to common shareholders. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Yield: A ratio calculated as the dividend per common share for the year divided by the daily average closing stock price during the year. Effective Income Tax Rate: A rate and performance indicator calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes as a percentage of net income before taxes. Adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated in the same manner using adjusted results. Effective Interest Rate (EIR): The rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The calculation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts. Effective Interest Rate Method (EIRM): A technique for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument’s book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Under EIRM, the effective interest rate, which is a key component of the calculation, discounts the expected future cash inflows and outflows expected over the life of a financial instrument. Efficiency Ratio: The efficiency ratio measures operating efficiency and is calculated by taking the non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue. A lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio, net of insurance service expenses (ISE) is calculated by dividing adjusted non-interest expenses by adjusted total revenue, net of ISE. Management believes presenting efficiency ratio net of ISE is aligned with industry reporting and allows for better assessment of operating results."

Expected Credit Losses (ECLs): ECLs are the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions that impact the Bank’s credit risk assessment. Fair Value: The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Under IFRS 9, if the asset passes the contractual cash flows test (named SPPI), the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classified. If the instrument is being held to collect contractual cash flows, that is, if it is not expected to be sold, it is measured as amortized cost. If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is measured at FVOCI. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Under IFRS 9, the classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI) and a business model assessment. Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in profit or loss. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): A U.S. government corporation which provides deposit insurance guaranteeing the safety of a depositor’s accounts in member banks. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in receivership (failed banks). Forward Contracts: Over-the-counter contracts between two parties that oblige one party to the contract to buy and the other party to sell an asset for a fixed price at a future date. Futures: Exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Hedging: A risk management technique intended to mitigate the Bank’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other market factors. The elimination or reduction of such exposure is accomplished by engaging in capital markets activities to establish offsetting positions. Impaired Loans: Loans where, in management’s opinion, there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent that the Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. Loss Given Default (LGD): It is the amount of the loss the Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a loan, which is expressed as a percentage of exposure at default. Mark-to-Market (MTM): A valuation that reflects current market rates as at the balance sheet date for financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Master Netting Agreements: Legal agreements between two parties that have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default or termination of any one contract. Net Corporate Expenses: Non-interest expenses related to corporate service and control groups which are not allocated to a business segment. Net Interest Margin: A non-GAAP ratio calculated as net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to measure performance. This metric is an indicator of the profitability of the Bank’s earning assets less the cost of funding. Adjusted net interest margin is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net interest income. Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC): Instruments (preferred shares and subordinated debt) that contain a feature or a provision that allows the financial institution to either permanently convert these instruments into common shares or fully write-down the instrument, in the event that the institution is no longer viable. Notional: A reference amount on which payments for derivative financial instruments are based. Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI): The regulator of Canadian federally chartered financial institutions and federally administered pension plans. Options: Contracts in which the writer of the option grants the buyer the future right, but not the obligation, to buy or to sell a security, exchange rate, interest rate, or other financial instrument or commodity at a predetermined price at or by a specified future date. Price-Earnings Ratio: A ratio calculated by dividing the closing share price by EPS based on a trailing four quarters to indicate market performance. Adjusted price-earnings ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted EPS. Probability of Default (PD): It is the likelihood that a borrower will not be able to meet its scheduled repayments. Provision for Credit Losses (PCL): Amount added to the allowance for credit losses to bring it to a level that management considers adequate to reflect expected credit-related losses on its portfolio. Return on Common Equity (ROE): The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity, utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. Adjusted ROE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Return on Risk-weighted Assets: Net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average risk-weighted assets. Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a percentage of average Tangible common equity. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Both measures can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA): Assets calculated by applying a regulatory risk-weight factor to on and off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight factors are established by the OSFI to convert on and off-balance sheet exposures to a comparable risk level. Securitization: The process by which financial assets, mainly loans, are transferred to structures, which normally issue a series of asset-backed securities to investors to fund the purchase of loans. Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI): IFRS 9 requires that the following criteria be met in order for a financial instrument to be classified at amortized cost: • The entity’s business model relates to managing financial assets (such as bank trading activity), and, as such, an asset is held with the intention of collecting its contractual cash flows; and • An asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI."

Tangible common equity (TCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as common shareholders’ equity less goodwill, imputed goodwill, and intangibles on an investment in Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other acquired intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. It can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Taxable Equivalent Basis (TEB): A calculation method (not defined in GAAP) that increases revenues and the provision for income taxes on certain tax exempt securities to an equivalent before-tax basis to facilitate comparison of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Tier 1 Capital Ratio: Tier 1 Capital represents the more permanent forms of capital, consisting primarily of common shareholders’ equity, retained earnings, preferred shares and innovative instruments. Tier 1 Capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 Capital divided by RWA. Total Capital Ratio: Total Capital is defined as the total of net Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital. Total Capital ratio is calculated as Total Capital divided by RWA. Total Shareholder Return (TSR): The total return earned on an investment in TD’s common shares. The return measures the change in shareholder value, assuming dividends paid are reinvested in additional shares. Trading-Related Revenue: A non-GAAP financial measure that is the total of trading income (loss), net interest income on trading positions, and income (loss) from financial instruments designated at FVTPL that are managed within a trading portfolio. Trading-related revenue (TEB) in the Wholesale Banking segment is also a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in the same manner, including TEB adjustments. Both are used for measuring trading performance. Value-at-Risk (VaR): A metric used to monitor and control overall risk levels and to calculate the regulatory capital required for market risk in trading activities. VaR measures the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of time."

        "page_content": "Page 55 NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) NOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS The Toronto-Dominion Bank is a bank chartered under the Bank Act (Canada). The shareholders of a bank are not, as shareholders, liable for any liability, act, or default of the bank except as otherwise provided under the Bank Act (Canada). The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”). The Bank was formed through the amalgamation on February 1, 1955, of The Bank of Toronto (chartered in 1855) and The Dominion Bank (chartered in 1869). The Bank is incorporated and domiciled in Canada with its registered and principal business offices located at 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario. TD serves customers in four business segments operating in a number of locations in key financial centres around the globe: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The accompanying Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting principles followed by the Bank have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including the accounting requirements of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. These Interim Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on a condensed basis in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting using the accounting policies as described in Note 2 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 2 of this report. Certain comparative amounts have been revised to conform with the presentation adopted in the current period. The preparation of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements requires that management make judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as further described in Note 3 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 3 of this report. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future confirming events occur. The Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. All intercompany transactions, balances, and unrealized gains and losses on transactions are eliminated on consolidation. The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, were approved and authorized for issue by the Bank’s Board of Directors, in accordance with a recommendation of the Audit Committee, on August 21, 2024. As the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the disclosures normally provided in the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, they should be read in conjunction with the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes, and the shaded sections of the 2023 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The risk management policies and procedures of the Bank are provided in the MD&A. The shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the MD&A in this report, relating to market, liquidity, and insurance risks, are an integral part of these Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, as permitted by IFRS. NOTE 2: CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following new standard has been adopted by the Bank on November 1, 2023. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17 which replaced the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) and became effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which was November 1, 2023 for the Bank. IFRS 17 establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk-adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The liabilities presented by insurance groups are comprised of the liability for remaining coverage (LRC) and the liability for incurred claims (LIC) and are reported as Insurance contract liabilities on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet. The LRC is the obligation to investigate and pay claims that have not yet occurred and includes the loss component related to onerous contract groups. The LIC is the estimate of claims incurred, including claims that have occurred but have not been reported, and related insurance costs. IFRS 17 introduces two measurement models that are applicable to the Bank, the premium allocation approach model (PAA) and the general measurement model (GMM). The Bank measures the majority of its insurance contract groups using the PAA, which includes property and casualty contracts as well as short-term life and health contracts. The PAA is a simplified model applied to insurance contracts that are either one year or less or where the PAA approximates the GMM. Contracts using the GMM are longer-term life and health contracts. The LRC for insurance contract groups using the PAA is measured as unearned premiums less deferred acquisition cash flows allocated to the group. The LRC is adjusted for the recognition of insurance revenue and amortization of acquisition cash flows reported in insurance service expenses on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the underlying insurance contracts, usually twelve months. The LRC for longer term contracts using the GMM model is measured using estimates and assumptions that reflect the timing and uncertainty of insurance cash flows. When a group of contracts is expected to be onerous, a loss component (expected loss related to fulfilling the related insurance contracts) is established which increases the LRC and insurance service expenses. The loss component of the LRC is subsequently recognized in income over the contractual term of the underlying insurance contracts to offset claims incurred and related expenses. The Bank measures the LIC at the present value of current estimates of claims and related costs for insurable events occurring at or before the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet date. The LIC includes a risk adjustment, which represents the compensation the Bank requires for bearing the uncertainty related to non-financial risks in its fulfilment of insurance contracts. Expenses related to claims incurred and related costs are reported in insurance service expenses and changes related to discounting the liability are recorded as insurance finance income or expenses in other income (loss). Prior to the adoption of IFRS 17, these expenses were recorded in insurance claims and related expenses and non-interest expenses. TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS"

        "page_content": "Page 56 Reinsurance contracts held are recognized and measured using the same principles as insurance contracts issued. Reinsurance contract assets are presented in Other assets on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet and the net results from reinsurance contracts held are presented in Other income (loss) on the Interim Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to Note 14 for further detail on the balances and results of insurance and reinsurance contracts. The Bank initially applied IFRS 17 on November 1, 2023 and restated the comparative period. The Bank transitioned by primarily applying the full retrospective approach which resulted in the measurement of insurance contracts as if IFRS 17 had always applied to them. The following table sets out adjustments to the Bank’s insurance-related balances reported under IFRS 4 as at October 31, 2022 used to derive the insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance contract assets recognized by the Bank as at November 1, 2022 under IFRS 17. (millions of Canadian dollars) A mount Insurance-related liabilities $ 7,468 Other liabilities 131 Other assets (2,361) Net insurance-related balances as at October 31, 2022 $ 5,238 Changes in actuarial assumptions, including risk adjustment and discount factor (192) Recognition of losses on onerous contracts 113 Other adjustments (93) Net insurance-related balances as at November 1, 2022 $ 5,066 Insurance contract liabilities $ 5,761 Reinsurance contract assets (695) Net insurance-related balances as at November 1, 2022 $ 5,066 On November 1, 2022, IFRS 17 transition adjustments resulted in a decrease to the Bank’s deferred tax assets of $60 million and an after-tax increase to retained earnings of $112 million. Upon the initial application of IFRS 17 on November 1, 2023, the Bank applied transitional guidance and reclassified certain securities supporting insurance operations to minimize accounting mismatches arising from the application of the new discount factor under IFRS 17. The transitional guidance for such securities is applicable for entities that previously used IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) and was applied without a restatement of comparatives. The reclassification resulted in a decrease to retained earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of $10 million. The following standard and amendments have been issued, but are not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements In April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18), which replaces the guidance in IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements and sets out requirements for presentation and disclosure of information, focusing on providing relevant information to users of the financial statements. IFRS 18 focuses on the presentation of financial performance in the statement of profit or loss. It will be effective for the Bank’s annual period beginning November 1, 2027. Early application is permitted. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard. Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments In May 2024, the IASB issued Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments, which amended IFRS 9 and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures. The amendments address matters identified during the post-implementation review of the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9. The amendments clarify how to assess the contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets that include environmental, social, and governance linked features and other similar contingent features. The amendments also clarify the treatment of non-recourse assets and contractually linked instruments. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that a financial liability is derecognized on the settlement date and provide an accounting policy choice to derecognize a financial liability settled using an electronic payment system before the settlement date if certain conditions are met. Finally, the amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements for financial instruments with contingent features and equity instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The amendments will be effective for the Bank’s annual period beginning November 1, 2026. Early adoption is permitted, with an option to early adopt the amendments for contingent features only. The Bank is required to apply the amendments retrospectively, but is not required to restate prior periods. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopting these amendments. NOTE 3: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a material impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The expected credit loss (ECL) model requires the application of judgments, estimates, and assumptions in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. There remains elevated economic uncertainty, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied.

        "page_content": "Page 57 Insurance Contracts The assumptions used in establishing the Bank’s insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are based on best estimates of possible outcomes. For property and casualty insurance contracts, the ultimate cost of LIC is estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques in accordance with Canadian accepted actuarial practices. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in the future, in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate claims cost amounts that present the most likely outcome taking into account all the uncertainties involved. For life and health insurance contracts, actuarial liabilities consider all future policy cash flows, including premiums, claims, and expenses required to administer the policies. Critical assumptions used in the measurement of life and health insurance contract liabilities are determined by the appointed actuary. Further information on insurance risk assumptions is provided in Note 14. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform As part of the interest rate benchmark reform, the remaining tenors of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) (one-month, two-month, and three-month) have ceased following a final publication on June 28, 2024. Consistent with its transition plan, the Bank’s exposure to financial instruments referencing CDOR is no longer significant to its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as at July 31, 2024. For further details regarding interest rate benchmark reform, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s approach and methodologies used to determine fair value measurements for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024.

This system is used to assess all non-retail exposures, including debt securities. The following table provides the gross carrying amounts of debt securities measured at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI by internal risk rating for credit risk management purposes, presenting separately those debt securities that are subject to Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 allowances.

For non-retail exposures, each borrower is assigned a BRR that reflects the probability of default (PD) of the borrower using proprietary industry and sector specific risk models and expert judgment. Refer to the shaded areas of the “Managing Risk” section of the 2023 MD&A for further details, including the mapping of PD ranges to risk levels for retail exposures as well as the Bank’s 21-point BRR scale to risk levels and external ratings for non-retail exposures.

The allowance for credit losses on all remaining financial assets is not significant. (e) FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Relevant macroeconomic factors are incorporated in risk parameters as appropriate. Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. The key macroeconomic variables used in determining ECLs include regional unemployment rates for all retail exposures and regional housing price indices for residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. For business and government loans, the key macroeconomic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, and credit spreads. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of how forward-looking information is generated and considered in determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and in measuring ECLs. Macroeconomic Variables Select macroeconomic variables are projected over the forecast period. The following table sets out average values of the macroeconomic variables over the four calendar quarters starting with the current quarter, and the remaining 4-year forecast period for the base forecast and upside and downside scenarios used in determining the Bank’s ECLs as at July 31, 2024. As the forecast period increases, information about the future becomes less readily available and projections are anchored on assumptions around structural relationships between economic parameters that are inherently much less certain. Restrictive monetary policy continues to contribute to elevated economic uncertainty, particularly in Canada where household debt levels remain elevated, and is likely to continue to weigh on near-term economic growth and lead to a further modest increase in the unemployment rate.

        "page_content": "- Page 70 (f) SENSITIVITY OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ECLs are sensitive to the inputs used in internally developed models, the macroeconomic variables in the forward-looking forecasts and respective probability weightings in determining the probability-weighted ECLs, and other factors considered when applying expert credit judgment. Changes in these inputs, assumptions, models, and judgments would affect the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of ECLs. The following table presents the base ECL scenario compared to the probability-weighted ECLs, with the latter derived from three ECL scenarios for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The difference reflects the impact of deriving multiple scenarios around the base ECLs and resultant change in ECLs due to non-linearity and sensitivity to using macroeconomic forecasts. Change from Base to Probability-Weighted ECLs (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) As at Ju ly 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 7,556 $ 7,149 Base ECLs 7,146 6,658 Difference – in amount $ 410 $ 491 Difference – in percentage 5.7 % 7.4 % ECLs for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments consist of an aggregate amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 probability-weighted ECLs which are twelve month ECLs and lifetime ECLs, respectively. Transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2 ECLs result from a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the loan. The following table shows the estimated impact of staging on ECLs by presenting all performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments calculated using twelve-month ECLs compared to the current aggregate probability-weighted ECLs, holding all risk profiles constant. Incremental Lifetime ECLs Impact (millions of Canadian dollars) As at Ju ly 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 7,556 $ 7,149 All performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments using 12-month ECLs 5,543 5,295 Incremental lifetime ECLs impact $ 2,013 $ 1,854 (g) FORECLOSED ASSETS Foreclosed assets are repossessed non-financial assets where the Bank gains title, ownership, or possession of individual properties, such as real estate properties, which are managed for sale in an orderly manner with the proceeds used to reduce or repay any outstanding debt. The Bank does not generally occupy foreclosed properties for its business use. The Bank predominantly relies on third-party appraisals to determine the carrying value of foreclosed assets. Foreclosed assets held for sale were $72 million as at July 31, 2024 (October 31, 2023 – $59 million) and were recorded in Other assets on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet. (h) LOANS PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED A loan is classified as past due when a borrower has failed to make a payment by the contractual due date. The following table summarizes loans that are past due but not impaired. Loans less than 31 days contractually past due are excluded as they do not generally reflect a borrower’s ability to meet their payment obligations.

        "page_content": "Page 71 NOTE 7: INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES The Bank has significant influence over The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) and the ability to participate in the financial and operating policy-making decisions of Schwab through a combination of the Bank’s ownership, board representation and the insured deposit account (“IDA”) agreement between the Bank and Schwab. As such, the Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The Bank’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. The Bank takes into account changes in the one-month lag period that would significantly affect the results. As at July 31, 2024, the Bank’s reported investment in Schwab was approximately 12.3% (October 31, 2023 – 12.4%), consisting of 9.8% of the outstanding voting common shares and the remainder in non-voting common shares of Schwab with an aggregate fair value of $20 billion (US$15 billion) (October 31, 2023 – $16 billion (US$12 billion)) based on the closing price of US$65.19 (October 31, 2023 – US$52.04) on the New York Stock Exchange. The Bank and Schwab are party to a stockholder agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”) under which the Bank has the right to designate two members of Schwab’s Board of Directors and has representation on two Board Committees, subject to the Bank meeting certain conditions. The Bank’s designated directors currently are the Bank’s Group President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank’s former Chair of the Board. Under the Stockholder Agreement, the Bank is not permitted to own more than 9.9% voting common shares of Schwab, and the Bank is subject to customary standstill restrictions and subject to certain exceptions, transfer restrictions. The carrying value of the Bank’s investment in Schwab of $10.0 billion as at July 31, 2024 (October 31, 2023 – $8.9 billion) represents the Bank’s share of Schwab’s stockholders’ equity, adjusted for goodwill, other intangibles, and cumulative translation adjustment. The Bank’s share of net income from its investment in Schwab of $190 million and $525 million during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, respectively (three and nine months ended July 31, 2023 – $182 million and $708 million, respectively), reflects net income after adjustments for amortization of certain intangibles net of tax. On August 21, 2024, the Bank announced that it had sold 40.5 million shares of common stock of Schwab. The shares are sold for proceeds of approximately $3.4 billion (US$2.5 billion). The share sale will reduce the Bank’s ownership interest in Schwab from 12.3% to 10.1%. The Bank is expected to recognize approximately $1.0 billion (US$0.7 billion) as other income (net of $0.5 billion (US$0.4 billion) loss from AOCI reclassified to earnings), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The Bank will continue to account for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The following tables represent the gross amount of Schwab’s total assets, liabilities, net revenues, net income available to common stockholders, other comprehensive income (loss), and comprehensive income (loss). Summarized Financial Information (millions of Canadian dollars) As at Ju ne 30 2024 September 30 2023 Total assets $ 615,493 $ 644,139 Total liabilities 555,332 592,923 (millions of Canadian dollars) F or the three months ended For the nine months ended Ju ne 30 2024 June 30 2023 June 30 2024 June 30 2023 Total net revenues $ 6,418 $ 6,253 $ 18,884 $ 20,633 Total net income available to common stockholders 1,657 1,575 4,605 6,119 Total other comprehensive income (loss) 876 (54) 5,195 3,277 Total comprehensive income (loss) 2,533 1,521 9,800 9,396 Insured Deposit Account Agreement On November 25, 2019, the Bank and Schwab signed an insured deposit account agreement (the “2019 Schwab IDA Agreement”), with an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. Under the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into an amended insured deposit account agreement (the “2023 Schwab IDA Agreement” or the “Schwab IDA Agreement”), which replaced the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement. Pursuant to the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank continues to make sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Schwab designates a portion of the deposits with the Bank as fixed-rate obligation amounts (FROA). Remaining deposits over FROA are designated as floating-rate obligations. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by three years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until September 2025, the aggregate FROA will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to $6.8 billion (US$5 billion) of FROA by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to certain limits. Refer to Note 27 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Schwab IDA Agreement. During the first quarter of 2024, Schwab exercised its option to buy down the remaining $0.7 billion (US$0.5 billion) of the US$5 billion FROA buydown allowance and paid $32 million (US$23 million) in termination fees to the Bank in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement. By the end of the first quarter of 2024, Schwab had completed its buy down of the full US$5 billion FROA buydown allowance and had paid a total of $337 million (US$250 million) in termination fees to the Bank. The fees were intended to compensate the Bank for losses incurred from discontinuing certain hedging relationships and for lost revenues. The net impact was recorded in net interest income.

The acquisition advances the Wholesale Banking segment’s long-term growth strategy in the U.S. and adds complementary products and services to the Bank’s existing businesses. The results of the acquired business have been consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and primarily reported in the Wholesale Banking segment. Consideration included $1,500 million (US$1,100 million) in cash for 100% of Cowen’s common shares outstanding, $253 million (US$186 million) for the settlement of Cowen’s Series A Preferred Stock, and $205 million (US$151 million) related to the replacement of share-based payment awards. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method. The acquisition contributed $10,793 million (US$7,928 million) of assets and $10,005 million (US$7,351 million) of liabilities. The excess of accounting consideration over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired was allocated to intangible assets of $298 million (US$219 million) net of taxes, and goodwill of $872 million (US$641 million). Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The Bank plans to dispose of certain non-core businesses that were acquired in connection with the Cowen acquisition. These non-core businesses are disposal groups which meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The assets and liabilities of these disposal groups are recorded in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the three months ended January 31, 2024, the Bank disposed of Cowen’s legacy prime brokerage and outsourced trading business that was classified as held for sale. As at July 31, 2024, assets of $760 million (October 31, 2023 – $1,958 million) and liabilities of $331 million (October 31, 2023 – $1,291 million) were classified as held for sale.

        "page_content": "Page 79 NOTE 19: PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Other than as described below, there have been no new significant events or transactions except as previously identified in Note 26 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. (a) RESTRUCTURING The Bank continued to undertake certain measures in the third quarter of 2024 to reduce its cost base and achieve greater efficiency. In connection with these measures, the Bank incurred $110 million and $566 million of restructuring charges during the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024, respectively. The restructuring costs primarily relate to: (i) employee severance and other personnel-related costs recorded as provisions and (ii) real estate optimization mainly recorded as a reduction to buildings. The restructuring program has concluded. (b) LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Other than as described below, there have been no new significant legal and regulatory matters, and no significant developments to the matters previously identified in Note 26 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, including but not limited to civil claims and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits, and requests for information by governmental, regulatory and self-regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions, in respect of our businesses and compliance programs. The Bank establishes provisions when it becomes probable that the Bank will incur a loss and the amount can be reliably estimated. The Bank also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) in its legal and regulatory actions (that is, those which are neither probable nor remote), in excess of provisions. As at July 31, 2024, the Bank’s RPL is from zero to approximately $1.33 billion (October 31, 2023 – from zero to approximately $1.44 billion). The Bank’s provisions and RPL represent the Bank’s best estimates based upon currently available information for actions for which estimates can be made, but there are a number of factors that could cause the Bank’s provisions and/or RPL to be significantly different from its actual or RPL. For example, the Bank’s estimates involve significant judgment due to the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants in many proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, some of which are beyond the Bank’s control and/or involve novel legal theories and interpretations, the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. In addition, some actions seek very large or indeterminate damages. In connection with the civil and criminal investigations into the Bank’s U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/anti-money laundering (AML) program by its U.S. prudential regulators, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and in anticipation of a global resolution, which will include monetary and non-monetary penalties, the Bank has taken a further provision of $3.57 billion (US$2.60 billion) to reflect the Bank’s current estimate of the total fines related to these matters. In the second quarter of 2024, the Bank took an initial provision of $615 million (US$450 million) in connection with its discussions with one of its U.S. regulators related to this matter. The Bank expects that a global resolution will be finalized by calendar year end. The Bank has been named as a defendant in four overlapping proposed class action lawsuits purporting to be brought on behalf of shareholders alleging that its disclosure with respect to its U.S. AML program has been misleading. None of these proposed class actions have been certified or granted leave to proceed by the court, and losses or damages cannot be estimated at this time. The Bank and certain of its subsidiaries have resolved the investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) concerning compliance with records preservation requirements relating to business communications exchanged on unapproved electronic channels. The Bank and its subsidiaries in the aggregate paid penalties totaling US$124.5 million, for which the Bank is fully provisioned, and agreed to various other customary terms similar to those imposed on other financial institutions that have resolved similar investigations. On May 31, 2024, the claims against the Bank were dismissed with prejudice in Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. On June 3, 2024, the United States Supreme Court denied R. Allen Stanford’s request for rehearing regarding the denial of his petition for a writ of certiorari in which he challenged the settlement in this action. This brings to a close the Stanford litigation in the United States. In the second quarter of 2024, the Bank and certain of its subsidiaries reached a settlement in principle relating to a civil matter, pursuant to which the Bank recorded a provision of $274 million. In management’s opinion, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the ultimate disposition of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or the consolidated cash flows of the Bank. However, because of the factors listed above, as well as other uncertainties inherent in litigation and regulatory matters, there is a possibility that the ultimate resolution of legal or regulatory actions may be material to the Bank’s consolidated results of operations for any particular reporting period.

        "page_content": "Page 80 NOTE 20: SEGMENTED INFORMATION For management reporting purposes, the Bank reports its results from business operations and activities under four key business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The Bank’s other activities are grouped into the Corporate segment. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking provides financial products and services to personal, small business and commercial customers, and includes TD Auto Finance Canada. U.S. Retail is comprised of personal and business banking in the U.S., TD Auto Finance U.S., the U.S. wealth business, as well as the Bank’s equity investment in Schwab. Wealth Management and Insurance includes the Canadian wealth business which provides investment products and services to institutional and retail investors, and the insurance business which provides property and casualty insurance, as well as life and health insurance products to customers across Canada. Effective the first quarter of 2024, certain asset management businesses which were previously reported in the U.S. Retail segment are now reported in the Wealth Management and Insurance segment. Comparative period information has been adjusted to reflect the new alignment. Wholesale Banking provides a wide range of capital markets, investment banking, and corporate banking products and services, including underwriting and distribution of new debt and equity issues, providing advice on strategic acquisitions and divestitures, and meeting the daily trading, funding, and investment needs of the Bank’s clients. The Corporate segment includes the effects of certain asset securitization programs, treasury management, elimination of taxable equivalent adjustments and other management reclassifications, corporate level tax items, and residual unallocated revenue and expenses. The following table summarizes the segment results for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023.

NOTE 22: REGULATORY CAPITAL The Bank manages its capital under guidelines established by OSFI. The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to credit, market, and operational risks. The Bank has various capital policies, procedures, and controls which it utilizes to achieve its goals and objectives. The Bank is designated as a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB) and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Canadian banks designated as D-SIBs are required to comply with OSFI’s minimum targets for risk-based capital and leverage ratios. The minimum targets include a D-SIB surcharge and Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, Total Capital and risk-based Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) ratios. The DSB level was increased to 3.5% as of November 1, 2023, which sets these minimum target ratios at 11.5%, 13.0%, 15.0% and 25.0%, respectively. The OSFI target includes the greater of the D-SIB or G-SIB surcharge, both of which are currently 1% for the Bank. On February 1, 2023, OSFI announced revisions to the Leverage Requirements Guideline to introduce a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the existing minimum requirement. This sets the minimum targets for leverage and TLAC leverage ratios at 3.5% and 7.25%, respectively. The Bank complied with all minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements set by OSFI in the nine months ended July 31, 2024. The following table summarizes the Bank’s regulatory capital positions as at July 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023. The impact to CET1 capital upon adoption of IFRS 17 is immaterial to the Bank.
