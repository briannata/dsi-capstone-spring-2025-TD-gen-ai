TORONTO, March 3, 2022 – TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended January 31, 2022. Reported earnings were $3.7 billion, up 14% compared with the first quarter last year, and adjusted earnings were $3.8 billion, up 13%. “TD started the year strong, delivering revenue growth across all our business segments as customer activity gained additional momentum,” said Bharat Masrani, Group President and CEO, TD Bank Group. “With a focus on growth, we continue to make investments in technology and new capabilities, positioning us well to meet our customers’ and clients’ evolving needs.” “I am also pleased to have announced our deal with First Horizon earlier this week. A bold acceleration of our U.S. strategy to acquire a premier regional bank, with a strong presence in highly attractive markets across the U.S. Southeast – a terrific strategic fit for TD,” added Masrani. Canadian Retail saw continued strength in client activity, volumes and revenue Canadian Retail net income was $2,254 million, an increase of 11% compared with the first quarter last year. The increase in earnings reflects record revenue and lower provisions for credit losses (PCL), partially offset by higher non-interest expenses. Revenue increased 6%, reflecting strong non-interest income growth across all lines of business and momentum in loan and deposit volumes. Expenses increased 8%, reflecting investments to support business growth, and volume driven expenses including higher variable compensation. PCL decreased by $109 million from the first quarter last year, reflecting lower impaired PCL and a higher recovery in performing PCL. Canadian Retail started the year with good momentum, delivering record revenue performance in the Personal and Commercial Bank, supported by increased customer activity. In Wealth, net asset growth and mutual fund sales balanced the impact of trading volume normalization and delivered revenue growth for the business. Forward-focused innovations continued to support customers in building financial confidence, including expanding the New to Canada bundle to include 12 months of free international transfers via the TD Global Transfers platform and the launch of TD Easy TradeTM, a new mobile trading app from TD Direct Investing, with no minimum balance or monthly fees and 50 free stock trades per client, per year. Strong recovery continued across U.S. Retail U.S. Retail net income was $1,272 million (US$1,006 million), an increase of 27% (30% in U.S. dollars) compared with the first quarter last year. The Bank’s investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation (Schwab) contributed $252 million (US$200 million) in earnings, an increase of 21% (24% in U.S. Dollars) compared with the first quarter last year. The U.S. Retail Bank, which excludes the Bank’s investment in Schwab, reported net income of $1,020 million (US$806 million), an increase of 29% (31% in U.S. dollars) from the first quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher revenue and lower PCL. Revenue increased 4% (6% in U.S. dollars), reflecting higher deposit volumes and margins, increased earnings on the investment portfolio and higher fee income, partially offset by lower loan margins. PCL was $21 million (US$17 million), lower by $114 million (US$86 million) from the same quarter last year, reflecting lower impaired and performing PCL. Expenses decreased 5% (4% in U.S. dollars), reflecting store optimization costs incurred in the prior year, which more than offset investments made in the business in the current quarter. The U.S. Retail Bank continued to provide ongoing support to help small business customers process loan forgiveness through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), while assisting mortgage, credit card and middle-market customers with their credit needs. The U.S. Retail Bank continued to invest in deepening customer experiences, building stronger communities and supporting colleagues. Enhancements to the TD Mobile app now provide debit card customers with the ability to easily request a digitally issued replacement once a card is reported lost, stolen or damaged. The Double UpSM Credit Card, added to the TD credit card suite last spring, became the primary driver of new Bankcard accounts, having added 98,000 accounts by quarter end. The Essential Banking deposit account, designed to provide better banking access to underserved communities, has resulted in 44,000 accounts since its official launch last August, helping to meet the needs of more customers, in more communities. TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank® opened its New York City flagship store, One Vanderbilt, serving as the largest store in TD’s U.S. footprint, providing customers greater convenience and accessibility.

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Bank’s unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in this Report to Shareholders and with the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes and 2021 MD&A. This MD&A is dated March 2, 2022. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars and have been primarily derived from the Bank’s 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes or Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes, prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. Note that certain comparative amounts have been revised to conform with the presentation adopted in the current period. Additional information relating to the Bank, including the Bank’s 2021 Annual Information Form, is available on the Bank’s website at http://www.td.com, as well as on SEDAR at http://www.sedar.com and on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov (EDGAR filers section). Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements From time to time, the Bank (as defined in this document) makes written and/or oral forward-looking statements, including in this document, in other filings with Canadian regulators or the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in other communications. In addition, representatives of the Bank may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. All such statements are made pursuant to the “safe harbour” provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“2021 MD&A”) in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report under the headings “Economic Summary and Outlook” and “The Bank’s Response to COVID-19”, under the headings “Key Priorities for 2022” and “Operating Environment and Outlook” for the Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading “Focus for 2022” for the Corporate segment, and in other statements regarding the Bank’s objectives and priorities for 2022 and beyond and strategies to achieve them, the regulatory environment in which the Bank operates, the Bank’s anticipated financial performance, and the potential economic, financial and other impacts of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “will”, “would”, “should”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”, “plan”, “goal”, “target”, “may”, and “could”. By their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond the Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, and infrastructure), model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors include the economic, financial, and other impacts of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates; geopolitical risk; the ability of the Bank to execute on long- term strategies and shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions, business retention plans, and strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks or data security breaches) on the Bank’s information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; model risk; fraud activity; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the Bank’s use of third-party service providers; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations, including without limitation tax laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance and the bank recapitalization “bail-in” regime; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; exposure related to significant litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes to the Bank’s credit ratings; changes in currency and interest rates (including the possibility of negative interest rates); increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition risk; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Bank; existing and potential international debt crises; environmental and social risk (including climate change); and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events. The Bank cautions that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Bank’s results. For more detailed information, please refer to the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as applicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the heading “Pending Acquisition” or “Significant and Subsequent Events and Pending Acquisitions” in the relevant MD&A, which applicable releases may be found on www.td.com. All such factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, should be considered carefully when making decisions with respect to the Bank. The Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on the Bank’s forward-looking statements. Material economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this document are set out in the 2021 MD&A under the headings “Economic Summary and Outlook” and “The Bank’s Response to COVID-19”, under the headings “Key Priorities for 2022” and “Operating Environment and Outlook” for the Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading “Focus for 2022” for the Corporate segment, each as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders. Any forward-looking statements contained in this document represent the views of management only as of the date hereof and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank’s shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank’s financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. The Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on its behalf, except as required under applicable securities legislation. This document was reviewed by the Bank’s Audit Committee and was approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors, on the Audit Committee’s recommendation, prior to its release. Page 4",

To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note”, from reported results. Refer to the “How We Performed” section of this document for further explanation, a list of the items of note, and a reconciliation of adjusted to reported results. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. 2 These measures have been included in this document in accordance with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada’s (OSFI’s) Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR), Leverage Requirements, and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guidelines.

TD is the fifth largest bank in North America by assets and serves more than 26 million customers in three key businesses operating in a number of locations in financial centres around the globe: Canadian Retail, which includes the results of the personal and commercial banking, wealth, and insurance businesses; U.S. Retail, which includes the results of the personal and business banking operations, wealth management services, and the Bank’s investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”); and Wholesale Banking. TD also ranks among the world’s leading online financial services firms, with more than 15 million active online and mobile customers. TD had $1.8 trillion in assets on January 31, 2022. The Toronto-Dominion Bank trades under the symbol “TD” on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges. The Bank prepares its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS and refers to results prepared in accordance with IFRS as “reported” results. Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures In addition to reported results, the Bank also presents certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures that are historical, non-GAAP ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures, to assess its results. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as “adjusted” results, are utilized to assess the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note”, from reported results. Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP ratios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the Bank’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. Supplementary financial measures depict the Bank’s financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the Bank’s capital position, and both are explained in this document where they first appear. U.S. Strategic Cards The Bank’s U.S. strategic cards portfolio is comprised of agreements with certain U.S. retailers pursuant to which TD is the U.S. issuer of private label and co- branded consumer credit cards to their U.S. customers. Under the terms of the individual agreements, the Bank and the retailers share in the profits generated by the relevant portfolios after credit losses. Under IFRS, TD is required to present the gross amount of revenue and PCL related to these portfolios in the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Statement of Income. At the segment level, the retailer program partners’ share of revenues and credit losses is presented in the Corporate segment, with an offsetting amount (representing the partners’ net share) recorded in Non-interest expenses, resulting in no impact to Corporate’s reported Net income (loss). The Net income (loss) included in the U.S. Retail segment includes only the portion of revenue and credit losses attributable to TD under the agreements. Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation On October 6, 2020, the Bank acquired an approximately 13.5% stake in Schwab following the completion of Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade (“Schwab transaction”). For further details, refer to Note 7 of the first quarter of 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method and reports its after-tax share of Schwab’s earnings with a one-month lag. The U.S. Retail segment reflects the Bank’s share of net income from its investment in Schwab. The Corporate segment net income (loss) includes amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction. The following table provides the operating results on a reported basis for the Bank.

Return on Common Equity The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. The consolidated Bank adjusted ROE is calculated as adjusted net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. Adjusted ROE is a non-GAAP financial ratio and can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Capital allocated to the business segments increased to 10.5% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital in the first quarter of 2022, compared with 9% in fiscal 2021. Page 7",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first quarter 2022 report highlights its position as the fifth largest bank in North America by assets, serving over 26 million customers across Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking. The bank had $1.8 trillion in assets as of January 31, 2022, and is a leading online financial services firm with over 15 million active online and mobile customers. TD Bank uses both IFRS-reported and non-GAAP financial measures to assess performance, with adjustments made for items not indicative of underlying business performance. The bank's U.S. strategic cards portfolio involves partnerships with U.S. retailers, sharing profits after credit losses. TD's investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation, acquired in 2020, is accounted for using the equity method, with its share of Schwab's earnings reflected in the U.S. Retail segment. For Q1 2022, TD reported net income of $3.733 billion, with adjusted net income at $3.833 billion. The report also details adjustments for amortization of acquired intangibles and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction. The bank's return on equity (ROE) is calculated using both reported and adjusted net income, with capital allocation aligned with Basel III requirements."

Shareholder performance indicators help guide and benchmark the Bank’s accomplishments. For the purposes of this analysis, the Bank utilizes adjusted earnings, which excludes items of note from the reported results that are prepared in accordance with IFRS. Reported and adjusted results and items of note are explained in “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in the “How We Performed” section of this document.  Adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended January 31, 2022, increased 13.7% from the same period last year.  Adjusted ROTCE for the three months ended January 31, 2022, was 20.8%.  For the twelve months ended January 31, 2022, the total shareholder return was 45.8% compared to the Canadian peer2 average of 48.7%. Net Income Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q1 2021 Reported net income for the quarter was $3,733 million, an increase of $456 million, or 14%, compared with the first quarter last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and lower PCL, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $3,833 million, an increase of $453 million, or 13%. By segment, the increase in reported net income reflects an increase in U.S. Retail of $272 million and an increase in Canadian Retail of $217 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Corporate segment of $30 million and a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $3 million. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q4 2021 Reported net income for the quarter decreased $48 million, or 1%, compared with the prior quarter. The decrease reflects higher PCL, higher insurance claims, and higher non-interest expenses, partially offset by higher revenues. Adjusted net income for the quarter decreased $33 million or 1%.

Non-Interest Income Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q1 2021 Reported non-interest income for the quarter was $4,979 million, an increase of $197 million, or 4%, compared with the first quarter last year. The increase reflects higher fee-based revenue in the banking and wealth businesses, and higher insurance volumes, partially offset by lower revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities, lower transaction revenue in the wealth business, and lower wholesale trading revenue. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest income reflects an increase in Canadian Retail of $266 million and an increase in U.S. Retail of $18 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Corporate segment of $75 million and a decrease in Wholesale Banking of $12 million. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q4 2021 Reported non-interest income for the quarter increased $300 million, or 6%, compared with the prior quarter. The increase primarily reflects higher wholesale trading revenue, higher fee-based revenue in the banking and wealth businesses, and prior quarter premium rebates for customers in the insurance business, partially offset by lower revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest income reflects an increase in Wholesale Banking of $176 million, an increase in Canadian Retail of $175 million, partially offset by a decrease in the Corporate segment of $45 million and a decrease in U.S. Retail of $6 million. Provision for Credit Losses PCL for the quarter was $72 million, a decrease of $241 million or 77%, compared with the first quarter last year. PCL – impaired was $329 million, a decrease of $137 million, largely related to improved credit conditions. PCL – performing was a recovery of $257 million, compared with a recovery of $153 million in the prior year, reflecting improved credit conditions, including a more favourable economic outlook. Total PCL for the quarter as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.04%. By segment, the decrease in PCL reflects a decrease of $114 million in U.S. Retail, a decrease of $109 million in Canadian Retail, and a decrease of $25 million in Wholesale Banking, partially offset by an increase of $7 million in the Corporate segment. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q4 2021 PCL for the quarter increased $195 million compared with prior quarter. PCL – impaired increased by $109 million. While still significantly below historical levels, the increase reflects early signs of normalization of credit performance. PCL – performing was a recovery of $257 million, compared with a recovery of $343 million in the prior quarter. The performing release this quarter reflects a more favourable economic outlook. Total PCL for the quarter as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.04%. 2 Canadian peers include Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Bank of Nova Scotia.

Insurance claims and related expenses Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q1 2021 Insurance claims and related expenses for the quarter were $756 million, a decrease of $24 million, or 3%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in non-interest income, partially offset by more severe weather-related events. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q4 2021 Insurance claims and related expenses for the quarter increased $106 million, or 16%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting higher current year claims, less favourable prior years’ claims development, and more severe weather-related events. Non-Interest Expenses and Efficiency Ratio Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q1 2021 Reported non-interest expenses were $5,967 million, an increase of $183 million, or 3%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting higher spend supporting business growth and higher employee-related expenses, partially offset by prior year store optimization costs and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Adjusted non-interest expenses were $5,897 million, an increase of $153 million, or 3%. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects an increase in Canadian Retail of $215 million, an increase in Wholesale Banking of $53 million, and an increase in the Corporate segment of $6 million, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. Retail of $91 million. The Bank’s reported efficiency ratio was 52.9% compared to 53.5% in the first quarter last year. The Bank’s adjusted efficiency ratio was 52.3%, compared with 53.1% in the first quarter last year. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q4 2021 Reported non-interest expenses for the quarter were $5,967 million, an increase of $20 million compared with the prior quarter. Adjusted non-interest expenses were $5,897 million, flat compared with the prior quarter. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects an increase in Wholesale Banking of $106 million, partially offset by a decrease in Canadian Retail of $43 million, a decrease in the Corporate segment of $23 million, and a decrease in U.S. Retail of $20 million. The Bank’s reported efficiency ratio was 52.9% compared with 54.4% in the prior quarter. The Bank’s adjusted efficiency ratio was 52.3%, compared with 53.9% in the prior quarter. Income Taxes As discussed in “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in the “How We Performed” section of this document, the Bank adjusts its reported results to assess each of its businesses and to measure overall Bank performance. As such, the provision for income taxes is stated on a reported and an adjusted basis. The Bank’s effective income tax rate on a reported basis was 21.9% for the current quarter, compared with 21.0% in the first quarter last year and 20.4% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the impact of higher pre-tax income. The quarter-over-quarter increase mainly reflects changes to the estimated liability for uncertain tax positions recorded in the prior quarter. To allow for an after-tax calculation of adjusted income, the adjusted provision for income taxes is calculated by adjusting the taxes for each item of note using the statutory income tax rate of the applicable legal entity. The adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated as the adjusted provision for income taxes before other taxes as a percentage of adjusted net income before taxes. The Bank’s adjusted effective income tax rate was 22.0% for the current quarter, compared with 21.0% in the first quarter last year and 20.4% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the impact of higher pre-tax income. The quarter- over-quarter increase mainly reflects changes to the estimated liability for uncertain tax positions recorded in the prior quarter. Adjusted results are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. Page 10",

The total provision for credit losses was $72 million, compared to a recovery of $123 million in the previous quarter and a provision of $313 million in the same quarter last year.\n\n2. **Insurance Claims and Expenses:** Insurance claims and related expenses decreased by 3% year-over-year to $756 million, due to a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities. However, they increased by 16% from the previous quarter, driven by higher current year claims and severe weather events.\n\n3. **Non-Interest Expenses and Efficiency Ratio:** Reported non-interest expenses increased by 3% year-over-year to $5,967 million, driven by business growth and higher employee-related expenses. The efficiency ratio improved slightly to 52.9% from 53.5% a year ago. Quarter-over-quarter, non-interest expenses rose by $20 million, with the efficiency ratio improving from 54.4% in the prior quarter.\n\n4. **Income Taxes:** The effective income tax rate increased to 21.9% from 21.0% a year ago and 20.4% in the previous quarter, reflecting higher pre-tax income and changes in estimated tax liabilities. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.0%, up from 21.0% a year ago and 20.4% in the prior quarter.\n\nOverall, the report indicates increased provisions for credit losses, higher insurance claims, and rising non-interest expenses, alongside improved efficiency ratios and higher effective tax rates."

The global economy had a solid year in calendar 2021, with gross domestic product (GDP) estimated to have grown by nearly 6%, more than recovering the output lost in 2020. Persistent disruptions related to COVID-19 and global supply chains, as well as a spike in energy prices, have weighed on growth and boosted inflation at the outset of calendar 2022. With increased vaccination rates and more effective treatments, economic activity is expected to pick up as advanced economies continue to ease restrictions on activity. However, the global outlook remains subject to downside risk from the emergence of new, more virulent or vaccine- resistant variants. In addition, the recent escalation in tensions between Russia and Ukraine is a downside geopolitical risk that warrants monitoring. High and persistent inflation has garnered a forceful response from global central banks in most advanced and emerging market economies. Some have already commenced raising policy rates, while others (such as the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve) have signaled that an increase is imminent. China, where concerns over flagging growth have led to an easing in monetary policy, is an exception. Tighter financial conditions alongside a shift in the composition of demand toward services and a steady alleviation in supply bottlenecks, should help to tame inflationary pressures, but the speed of the adjustment is highly uncertain. The U.S. economy ended 2021 on a strong note, growing by an estimated 6.9% annualized in the fourth calendar quarter, accelerating from 2.3% in the third quarter. Much of the uptick was due to a rebuilding in business inventories, which had been depleted by the combination of strong demand for goods and supply chain disruptions earlier in the year. Consumer spending growth also improved across many categories, although it decelerated in areas highly sensitive to the pandemic, such as food services and accommodation. The U.S. labour market made considerable strides over the past year, with non-farm payrolls up 4.6% year-on-year in January 2022. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.0% in the month, but is just 0.5 percentage points above its February 2020 pre-pandemic low. Still, the labour market has not made a full recovery. As of January 2022, payrolls were 2.9 million (1.9%) below pre-pandemic levels and there were nearly one million fewer people in the labour force. With historically high job openings, the mismatch between labor supply and demand has pushed up nominal wage growth to the highest rate in over 20 years. Despite this, wage growth has not kept pace with the increase in consumer prices. In January, the year-on-year percent change in the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) hit a 40-year high of 7.5%. Over half of the increase in the CPI was due to rising gasoline and vehicle prices. Energy prices have pushed even higher at the outset of 2022, and while auto production and sales picked up at the start of the year, supply shortages have continued to weigh on motor vehicle manufacturing. Over time, increases in energy and vehicle production should help to moderate the increase in transportation prices, but other sources of price pressures may take their place. Home price and rent measures have risen by double-digit rates and will likely translate into faster shelter price growth within the CPI measure in the coming months. The Federal Reserve has responded to high inflation by signaling the conclusion of its quantitative easing (QE) program in early March and its intention to begin raising the federal funds rate, which TD Economics anticipates will happen at its next meeting in March 2022. Thereafter, TD Economics expects the federal funds rate to increase in 25 basis points (bps) increments three more times over the course of calendar 2022, bringing it to 1.25% by the end of the calendar year. The timing and magnitude of future rate increases may be altered should inflationary pressures fail to ease at a pace consistent with the central bank’s expectations. The Canadian economy accelerated in the final calendar quarter of 2021, buoyed by strong growth in the early months of the quarter. By November, real GDP pushed above its pre-pandemic level by an estimated 0.2%. Growth was broad-based, with both goods and service industries growing strongly. Activity appears to have stalled in December 2021 and January 2022, as the rapidly spreading Omicron variant once again led to mobility restrictions across the country. However, provincial governments embarked on reopening plans in February that, if sustained, should result in a noticeable pick-up in activity through the late winter and early spring months. The Canadian labour market added jobs at a record clip in 2021. The re-imposition of restrictions on activity resulted in a sizeable pullback of 200,000 jobs in January, causing the unemployment rate to rise to 6.5% from 6.0%. However, the rise in unemployment was entirely due to an increase in people on temporary lay-off or scheduled to start a job in the near future. The labour force remains on a solid footing and is larger than it was prior to the pandemic. As 2022 unfolds, ongoing pockets of weakness in high-contact service industries, such as leisure and hospitality, should improve. As in the United States, demand for labour is strong across industries, and job growth is expected to remain healthy. Canadian home sales continued to move higher through the end of last year. Upward pressure on home prices reflects the combination of healthy demand and limited inventory, with the number of homes for sale hitting a record low in December. Average home prices were up close to 20% year-on-year in December, the second year of double-digit growth. As the Bank of Canada raises rates, the corresponding increase in mortgage rates is likely to slow housing demand over the next year, but limited inventories are expected to support prices. CPI inflation is lower in Canada than in the United States, but hit a 30-year high of 5.1% in January 2022. The outlook for inflation will depend on the trajectory of supply constraints and the pace of demand growth. With energy prices continuing to move higher and global supply disruptions prolonged by the spread of Omicron, inflation is likely to remain elevated at the outset of 2022. The Bank of Canada kept its overnight interest rate at 0.25% in January, but has clearly signaled its intention to raise rates. In addition, it has already ended its asset purchases and has communicated its intention to begin reducing the size of its balance sheet alongside increases in its policy rate. TD Economics expects the overnight rate to rise by 25 bps in March and anticipates three more 25 bps increases before the end of the calendar year, bringing it to 1.25% by the end of the year. With interest rates set to increase by the same amount in Canada and the United States, the Canadian dollar is expected to remain in a range of 79-81 U.S. cents over the next two years. Page 11",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first-quarter 2022 report highlights several key financial and economic insights:\n\n1. **Income Taxes**: The reported provision for income taxes was $984 million with an effective tax rate of 21.9% for the quarter ending January 31, 2022. Adjustments led to an adjusted provision of $1,001 million with a 22.0% effective tax rate.\n\n2. **Global Economic Outlook**: The global economy rebounded in 2021 with a GDP growth of nearly 6%. However, challenges such as COVID-19 disruptions, supply chain issues, and rising energy prices have increased inflation at the start of 2022. Central banks are responding with policy rate hikes, except for China, which is easing monetary policy due to growth concerns.\n\n3. **U.S. Economic Conditions**: The U.S. economy grew by 6.9% annualized in Q4 2021, driven by inventory rebuilding and consumer spending. The labor market improved, but inflation hit a 40-year high of 7.5% in January 2022, largely due to energy and vehicle prices. The Federal Reserve plans to raise interest rates to combat inflation.\n\n4. **Canadian Economic Conditions**: Canada's economy surpassed pre-pandemic GDP levels by late 2021, but growth stalled due to the Omicron variant. The labor market remains strong despite a temporary job loss in January 2022. Home prices continue to rise due to high demand and low inventory. Inflation reached a 30-year high of 5.1% in January 2022. The Bank of Canada is expected to raise interest rates, mirroring U.S. rate hikes, which should stabilize the Canadian dollar.\n\nOverall, the report underscores the challenges of inflation and supply chain disruptions while highlighting the anticipated monetary policy responses in Canada and the U.S. to address these issues."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS For management reporting purposes, the Bank reports its results under three key business segments: Canadian Retail, which includes the results of the personal and commercial banking, wealth, and insurance businesses; U.S. Retail, which includes the results of the personal and business banking operations, wealth management services, and the Bank’s investment in Schwab; and Wholesale Banking. The Bank’s other activities are grouped into the Corporate segment. Results of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the Bank measures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments, the Bank indicates that the measure is adjusted. For further details, refer to the “How We Performed” section of this document, the “Business Focus” section in the Bank’s 2021 MD&A, and Note 29 of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2021. PCL related to performing (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and impaired (Stage 3) financial assets, loan commitments, and financial guarantees is recorded within the respective segment. Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt income, including certain dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking’s results are reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the quarter was $38 million, compared with $36 million in the prior quarter and $42 million in the first quarter last year. Share of net income from investment in Schwab is reported in the U.S. Retail segment. Amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction are recorded in the Corporate segment.

Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q1 2021 Canadian Retail net income for the quarter was $2,254 million, an increase of $217 million, or 11%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting higher revenue and lower PCL, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses. The annualized ROE for the quarter was 44.8%, compared with 46.0% in the first quarter last year. Canadian Retail revenue is derived from the personal and business banking, wealth, and insurance businesses. Revenue for the quarter was $6,718 million, an increase of $373 million, or 6%, compared with the first quarter last year. Net interest income was $3,085 million, an increase of $107 million, or 4%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting volume growth, partially offset by lower margins. Average loan volumes increased $40 billion, or 9%, reflecting 8% growth in personal loans and 14% growth in business loans. Average deposit volumes increased $40 billion, or 9%, reflecting 7% growth in personal deposits, 13% growth in business deposits, and 9% growth in wealth deposits. Net interest margin was 2.53%, a decrease of 12 bps, reflecting changes to balance sheet mix, lower margins on loans, and lower mortgage prepayment revenue. Non-interest income was $3,633 million, an increase of $266 million, or 8%, reflecting higher fee-based revenue in the banking and wealth businesses, and higher insurance volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in insurance claims, and lower transaction revenue in the wealth business. Assets under administration (AUA) were $557 billion as at January 31, 2022, an increase of $73 billion, or 15%, and assets under management (AUM) were $429 billion as at January 31, 2022, an increase of $49 billion, or 13%, compared with the first quarter last year, both reflecting market appreciation and net asset growth. PCL was $33 million, a decrease of $109 million, compared with the first quarter last year. PCL – impaired for the quarter was $150 million, a decrease of $17 million, or 10%. PCL – performing was a recovery of $117 million, compared with a recovery of $25 million in the prior year, reflecting improved credit conditions, including a more favourable economic outlook. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.03%, a decrease of 9 bps compared with the first quarter last year. Insurance claims and related expenses for the quarter were $756 million, a decrease of $24 million, or 3%, compared with the first quarter last year reflecting a decrease in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities which resulted in a similar decrease in non-interest income, partially offset by more severe weather-related events. Non-interest expenses for the quarter were $2,869 million, an increase of $215 million, or 8%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting higher spend supporting business growth, including technology and marketing costs, higher employee-related expenses and variable compensation. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 42.7%, compared with 41.8% in the first quarter last year. Page 12",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first-quarter 2022 report highlights the performance of its Canadian Retail segment, which saw a net income increase of 11% to $2,254 million compared to the same quarter last year. This growth was driven by higher revenue and lower provisions for credit losses (PCL), despite an increase in non-interest expenses. Revenue rose by 6% to $6,718 million, with net interest income up by 4% due to volume growth, although net interest margins decreased by 12 basis points. Non-interest income increased by 8%, supported by higher fee-based revenue and insurance volumes. Assets under administration and management grew by 15% and 13%, respectively, due to market appreciation and net asset growth. PCL decreased significantly, reflecting improved credit conditions. Non-interest expenses rose by 8% due to investments in business growth and higher employee-related costs. The efficiency ratio slightly worsened to 42.7% from 41.8% in the previous year."

Trading-related revenue (TEB) is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to “Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures” in the “How We Performed” section and the Glossary of this document for additional information about this metric. 2 Includes gross loans and bankers’ acceptances relating to Wholesale Banking, excluding letters of credit, cash collateral, credit default swaps, and allowance for credit losses. 3 Capital allocated to the business segment was increased to 10.5% CET1 Capital effective the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with 9% in the prior year. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q1 2021 Wholesale Banking net income for the quarter was $434 million, a decrease of $3 million, or 1%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting higher revenue and lower PCL, offset by higher non-interest expenses. Wholesale Banking revenue is derived primarily from capital markets and corporate and investment banking services provided to corporate, government, and institutional clients. Wholesale Banking generates revenue from corporate lending, advisory, underwriting, sales, trading and research, client securitization, trade finance, cash management, prime services, and trade execution services. Revenue for the quarter was $1,346 million, an increase of $36 million, or 3%, compared with the first quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher loan fees and prime services revenue. PCL for the quarter was a recovery of $5 million, lower by $25 million compared with the first quarter last year. PCL – impaired was a recovery of $4 million, lower by $14 million. PCL – performing was a recovery of $1 million, lower by $11 million. Non-interest expenses were $764 million, an increase of $53 million, or 7%, compared with the first quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher employee- related costs from continued investment in Wholesale Banking’s U.S. dollar strategy, including the investments in TD Securities Automated Trading. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q4 2021 Wholesale Banking net income for the quarter was $434 million, an increase of $14 million, or 3%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher non-interest expenses and a lower PCL recovery. Revenue for the quarter increased $196 million, or 17%, primarily reflecting higher trading-related revenue, partially offset by lower advisory fees. PCL for the quarter was a recovery of $5 million, compared with a recovery of $77 million in the prior quarter. PCL – impaired was a recovery of $4 million. PCL – performing was a recovery of $1 million, compared with a recovery of $63 million in the prior quarter. Non-interest expenses for the quarter increased $106 million, or 16%, primarily reflecting higher variable compensation.

Debt securities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses increased $27 billion reflecting new investments and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by maturities. Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements decreased $1 billion primarily reflecting a decrease in volume. Loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased $21 billion reflecting volume growth in business and government loans, real estate secured lending, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Other assets decreased $5 billion primarily reflecting a decrease in amounts receivable from brokers, dealers and clients reflecting lower volumes of pending trades, partially offset by an increase in current income tax receivable. Total liabilities were $1,677 billion as at January 31, 2022, an increase of $48 billion, or 3%, from October 31, 2021. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the depreciation in the Canadian dollar increased total liabilities by $22 billion, or approximately 1%. The increase in total liabilities reflects deposits of $34 billion, financial liabilities designated at FVTPL of $21 billion and obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements of $1 billion. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in derivatives of $5 billion, trading deposits of $2 billion, and other liabilities of $1 billion.

        "chunk": "Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss increased $21 billion primarily reflecting new issuances, partially offset by maturities. Deposits increased $34 billion reflecting volume growth in personal deposits, business and government deposits, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $1 billion reflecting an increase in volume. Other liabilities decreased $1 billion primarily reflecting a decrease in amounts payable to brokers, dealers and clients, payments for dividends and preferred share redemptions accrued in the prior period, partially offset by higher obligations related to securities sold short. Equity was $102 billion as at January 31, 2022, an increase of $2 billion, or 2%, from October 31, 2021. The increase primarily reflects an increase in retained earnings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q1 2021 Gross impaired loans excluding acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans were $2,560 million as at January 31, 2022, a decrease of $497 million, or 16%, compared with the first quarter last year. Canadian Retail gross impaired loans decreased $278 million, or 23%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting improved credit conditions in the consumer and commercial lending portfolios. U.S. Retail gross impaired loans decreased $208 million, or 11%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting improved credit conditions in the consumer and commercial lending portfolios, and the impact of foreign exchange. Wholesale gross impaired loans decreased $11 million or 61%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting resolutions outpacing formations. Net impaired loans were $1,880 million as at January 31, 2022, a decrease of $400 million, or 18%, compared with the first quarter last year. The allowance for credit losses of $7,148 million as at January 31, 2022 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $686 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,798 million and Stage 1 allowance of $2,657 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $7 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses decreased $113 million, or 14%, reflecting improved credit conditions, and largely recorded in the consumer lending portfolios. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses decreased $1,683 million, or 21%, largely related to releases reflective of improved credit conditions, including a more favourable economic outlook, and the impact of foreign exchange. The allowance change included a decrease of $316 million attributable to the retailer program partners’ share of the U.S. strategic cards portfolio. The allowance for debt securities decreased by $1 million compared with the first quarter last year. Forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables deemed to be predictive of expected credit losses (ECLs) based on the Bank’s experience, is used to determine ECL scenarios and associated probability weights to establish the probability-weighted ECLs. Each quarter, all base forecast macroeconomic variables are refreshed, resulting in new upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios. The probability weightings assigned to each ECL scenario are also reviewed each quarter and updated as required, as part of the Bank’s ECL governance process. As a result of periodic reviews and quarterly updates, the allowance for credit losses may be revised to reflect updates in loss estimates based on the Bank’s recent loss experience and its forward-looking views, including the impact of COVID-19. The Bank periodically reviews the methodology and has performed certain additional qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s first quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on forward-looking information. The probability-weighted allowance for credit losses reflects the Bank’s forward-looking views. To the extent that certain anticipated effects cannot be fully incorporated into quantitative models, management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in determining the amount of ECLs by considering reasonable and supportable information. There remains considerable uncertainty regarding the economic trajectory and the ultimate credit impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the allowance for credit losses will be updated in future quarters as additional information becomes available. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s first quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Bank calculates allowances for ECLs on debt securities measured at amortized cost and FVOCI. The Bank has $365 billion in such debt securities, all of which are performing (Stage 1 and 2) and none are impaired (Stage 3). The allowance for credit losses on DSAC and debt securities at FVOCI was $2 million and $5 million, respectively. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2022 vs. Q4 2021 Gross impaired loans excluding ACI loans increased $149 million, or 6%, compared with the prior quarter, reflected in the U.S. consumer lending portfolios, largely related to real estate secured loans that exited deferral programs, and the impact of foreign exchange. Impaired loans net of allowance increased $98 million, or 5%, compared with the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses of $7,148 million as at January 31, 2022 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $686 million, Stage 2 allowance of $3,798 million and Stage 1 allowance of $2,657 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $7 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $48 million, or 8%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting some early signs of credit normalization, including seasonal trends in the U.S. credit card and auto portfolios. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses decreased $153 million, or 2%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting a more favourable economic outlook, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange. The allowance for debt securities decreased by $2 million compared to the prior quarter. For further details on loans, impaired loans, allowance for credit losses, and on the Bank’s use of forward-looking information and macroeconomic variables in determining its allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 6 of the Bank’s first quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.

Real Estate Secured Lending Retail real estate secured lending includes mortgages and lines of credit to North American consumers to satisfy financing needs including home purchases and refinancing. While the Bank retains first lien on the majority of properties held as security, there is a small portion of loans with second liens, but most of these are behind a TD mortgage that is in first position. In Canada, credit policies are designed so that the combined exposure of all uninsured facilities on one property does not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination. Lending at a higher loan-to-value ratio is permitted by legislation but requires default insurance. This insurance is contractual coverage for the life of eligible facilities and protects the Bank’s real estate secured lending portfolio against potential losses caused by borrowers’ default. The Bank may also purchase default insurance on lower loan-to-value ratio loans. The insurance is provided by either government-backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers. In the U.S., for residential mortgage originations, mortgage insurance is usually obtained from either government- backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers when the loan-to-value exceeds 80% of the collateral value at origination. The Bank regularly performs stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio as part of its overall stress testing program. This is done with a view to determine the extent to which the portfolio would be vulnerable to a severe downturn in economic conditions. The effect of severe changes in house prices, interest rates, and unemployment levels are among the factors considered when assessing the impact on credit losses and the Bank’s overall profitability. A variety of portfolio segments, including dwelling type and geographical regions, are examined during the exercise to determine whether specific vulnerabilities exist.

        "summary": "The financial text provides an overview of TD Bank's financial performance and credit risk management for the first quarter of 2022. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Liabilities and Deposits**: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss increased by $21 billion due to new issuances, while deposits grew by $34 billion, driven by personal, business, and government deposits, and foreign exchange impacts.\n\n2. **Equity and Impaired Loans**: Equity rose by $2 billion to $102 billion, mainly due to increased retained earnings and foreign exchange effects. Gross impaired loans decreased by 16% year-over-year, reflecting improved credit conditions in both Canadian and U.S. retail sectors.\n\n3. **Allowance for Credit Losses**: The total allowance for credit losses was $7,148 million, with a decrease in Stage 1 and 2 allowances by 21% due to improved economic outlooks and foreign exchange impacts. The Stage 3 allowance decreased by 14%, indicating better credit conditions.\n\n4. **Forward-Looking Information**: The bank uses macroeconomic variables to predict expected credit losses (ECLs) and updates these scenarios quarterly. The allowance for credit losses is adjusted based on these forward-looking views, considering the ongoing uncertainty from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n5. **Real Estate Lending**: The bank's real estate secured lending portfolio is stress-tested for economic downturns, with insurance coverage for high loan-to-value ratios. The total Canadian real estate secured lending increased slightly from the previous quarter.\n\nOverall, the report highlights TD Bank's financial stability, improved credit conditions, and proactive risk management strategies."

Derivatives are presented as net exposures where there is an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreement. 3 Trading exposures are net of eligible short positions. 4 In addition to the exposures identified above, the Bank also has $34.3 billion (October 31, 2021 – $32.5 billion) of exposure to supranational entities. Capital requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) are commonly referred to as Basel III. Under Basel III, Total Capital consists of three components, namely CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III introduced a non-risk sensitive leverage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage exposure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. TD continued to manage its regulatory capital in accordance with the Basel III Capital Framework as discussed in the “Capital Position” section of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III OSFI’s Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guideline details how the Basel III capital rules apply to Canadian banks. Other requirements, in addition to those described in “OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III” section of Bank’s 2021 Annual Report, are noted below. On March 13, 2020, as part of its COVID-19 response, OSFI announced that the Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB), previously set to increase to 2.25% effective April 30, 2020, was being lowered to 1.00% effective immediately. On June 17, 2021, OSFI announced that the DSB would increase to 2.50% of total RWA, effective October 31, 2021. On December 10, 2021, OSFI announced that the DSB will remain at 2.50% of total RWA. The Bank continued to maintain its Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) status when the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published the 2021 list of G-SIBs on November 23, 2021. As a result of the designation, the Bank continues to be subject to an additional loss absorbency requirement (CET1 as a percentage of RWA) of 1%. As the Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) surcharge is currently equivalent to the 1% G-SIB requirement, the Bank’s G-SIB designation has no additional impact on the Bank’s minimum CET1 regulatory requirements. On September 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guideline. Under this guideline, the Bank was required to meet supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.0% of RWA, inclusive of the 2.50% DSB, and TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75% by November 1, 2021. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio. The table below summarizes OSFI’s current regulatory minimum capital and TLAC ratios for the Bank. Minimum Capital Conservation Buffer D-SIB / G-SIB Surcharge1 Pillar 1 Regulatory target2 DSB3 Pillar 1 & 2 regulatory target CET1 4.5 % 2.5 % 1.0 % 8.0 % 2.5 % 10.5 % Tier 1 6.0 2.5 1.0 9.5 2.5 12.0 Total Capital 8.0 2.5 1.0 11.5 2.5 14.0 TLAC 18.0 2.5 1.0 21.5 2.5 24.0 1 The higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharge applies.

        "chunk": "Effective January 1, 2013, all newly issued non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital instruments must include non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) provisions to qualify as regulatory capital. NVCC provisions require the conversion of non-common capital instruments into a variable number of common shares of the Bank upon the occurrence of a trigger event. A trigger event is defined as an event where OSFI determines that the Bank is, or is about to become, non-viable and that after conversion of all non-common capital instruments, the viability of the Bank is expected to be restored, or if the Bank has accepted or agreed to accept a capital injection or equivalent support from a federal or provincial government of Canada without which the Bank would have determined by OSFI to be non-viable. Non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments issued prior to January 1, 2013, which did not include NVCC provisions were non-qualifying capital instruments and subject to a phase-out period which began in 2013 and ended on November 1, 2021. In fiscal 2020, OSFI introduced a number of measures to support D-SIBs’ ability to supply credit to the economy during an expected period of disruption related to COVID-19 and market conditions. These measures, and subsequent guidance issued by OSFI, are described in the “OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III” section of Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. Global Systemically Important Banks Disclosures The FSB, in consultation with the BCBS and national authorities, identifies G-SIBs. In July 2013, the BCBS issued an update to the final rules on G-SIBs and outlined the G-SIB assessment methodology which is based on the submissions of the largest global banks. In July 2018, BCBS issued a revised G-SIB framework; G-SIBs: Revised Assessment Methodology and the Higher Loss Absorbency Requirement. The new assessment methodology introduces a trading volume indicator and modifies the weights in the substitutability category, amends the definition of cross-jurisdictional indicators, extends the scope of consolidation to insurance subsidiaries, and provides further guidance on bucket migration and associated loss absorbency surcharges. The revised methodology came into effect in 2022, using 2021 year-end data. The thirteen indicators are used in the G-SIB assessment methodology to determine systemic importance. The score for a particular indicator is calculated by dividing the individual bank value by the aggregate amount for the indicator summed across all banks included in the assessment. Accordingly, an individual bank’s ranking is reliant on the results and submissions of other global banks. The Bank is required to publish the thirteen indicators used in the G-SIB indicator-based assessment framework. Public disclosure of financial year-end data is required annually, no later than the date of a bank’s first quarter public disclosure of shareholder financial data in the following year. The public communications on G-SIB status is issued annually each November. On November 22, 2019, the Bank was designated as a G-SIB by the FSB. The Bank continued to maintain its G-SIB status when the FSB published the 2021 list of G-SIBs on November 23, 2021. As a result of this designation, the Bank is subject to an additional loss absorbency requirement (CET1 as a percentage of RWA) of 1% under applicable FSB member authority requirements; however, in accordance with OSFI’s CAR guideline, for Canadian banks designated as a G-SIB, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply. As the D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the incremental 1% G-SIB common equity ratio requirement, the Bank’s G-SIB designation has no additional impact on the Bank’s minimum CET1 regulatory requirements. There is also currently no impact to the supervisory target risk-based TLAC ratio of 24.0% or TLAC leverage ratio of 6.75% as a result of the Bank’s G SIB requirements. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%. As a result of the Bank’s G-SIB designation, the U.S. Federal Reserve requires TD Group US Holding LLC (TDGUS), as TD’s U.S. Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC and long-term debt. From the date the Bank was designated as a G-SIB, TDGUS has a three-year transitional period to meet these requirements. The indicator-based measurement approach, currently in effect, divides the thirteen indicators into five categories, with each category yielding a 20% weight to a bank’s total score on the G-SIB scale as per the following table.

The text also discusses measures introduced by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) in 2020 to support Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) during COVID-19 disruptions. Additionally, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revised the G-SIB assessment methodology in 2018, effective in 2022, which includes new indicators and requirements. The Bank was designated as a G-SIB in 2019, subjecting it to a 1% additional loss absorbency requirement, although this does not impact its minimum regulatory requirements due to equivalent D-SIB surcharges. The U.S. Federal Reserve requires the Bank's U.S. Intermediate Holding Company to meet specific TLAC and long-term debt requirements within a three-year transition period."

        "chunk": "Category (and weighting) Individual indicator (and weighting) Category background Cross-jurisdictional activity (20%) 1. Cross-jurisdictional claims (10%) 2. Cross-jurisdictional liabilities (10%) This category measures the importance of the bank’s activities outside its home jurisdiction, relative to overall activity of other banks. The two indicators reflect how the international impact of a bank’s distress or failure would vary in line with its share of cross-jurisdictional assets and liabilities. Size (20%) 3. Total exposures as defined for use in the Basel III leverage ratio (20%) This category measures the size of the bank. The larger the bank, the more difficult it is for its activities to be quickly replaced by other banks and therefore the greater the chance that its distress or failure would cause disruption to the financial markets in which it operates. The distress or failure of a large bank is also more likely to damage confidence in the financial system as a whole. Size is therefore a key measure of systemic importance. Interconnectedness (20%) 4. Intra-financial system assets (6.67%) 5. Intra-financial system liabilities (6.67%) 6. Securities outstanding (6.67%) This category measures the magnitude of dependence amongst banks. Given the network of contractual obligations in which the banks operate, financial distress at one institution can materially increase the likelihood of distress at other institutions. A bank’s systemic impact is likely to be positively related to its interconnectedness vis-à-vis other financial institutions. Substitutability / financial institution infrastructure (20%) 7. Assets under custody (6.67%) 8. Payments activity (6.67%) 9. Underwritten transactions in debt and equity markets (3.33%) 10. Trading Volume (includes the two sub indicators) (3.33%) –Trading volume fixed income sub indicator –Trading volume equities and other securities sub indicator This category measures substitutability/financial institution infrastructure. The systemic impact of a bank’s distress of failure is expected to be negatively related to its degree of substitutability as both a market participant and a client service provider. The greater a bank’s role in a particular business line, or as a service provider in underlying market infrastructure (for example, payment systems), the larger the disruption will likely be following its failure, in terms of both service gaps and reduced flow of market and infrastructure liquidity. At the same time, the cost to the failed bank’s customers in having to seek the same service from another institution is likely to be higher for a failed bank with relatively greater market share in providing the service. Complexity (20%) 11. Notional amount of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives (6.67%) 12. Trading and other securities (6.67%) 13. Level 3 assets (6.67%) This category measures the complexity of the bank. The systemic impact of a bank’s distress or failure is expected to be positively related to its overall complexity – that is, its business, structural, and operational complexity. The more complex a bank is, the greater are the costs and time needed to resolve the bank. The following table provides the results of the thirteen indicators for the Bank. The increase in Intra-financial system liabilities was primarily due to increased deposits. Assets under custody increased due to market appreciation and new asset growth.

        "summary": "The text outlines the Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) indicators for a bank, focusing on five key categories: cross-jurisdictional activity, size, interconnectedness, substitutability/financial institution infrastructure, and complexity. Each category is weighted at 20% and includes specific indicators that measure the bank's systemic importance and potential impact on the financial system in case of distress or failure. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Cross-jurisdictional Activity**: This measures the bank's international operations, with increases in both cross-jurisdictional claims and liabilities from the previous year.\n\n2. **Size**: The bank's total exposures, as defined by the Basel III leverage ratio, have increased, indicating its large size and potential systemic impact.\n\n3. **Interconnectedness**: There was a notable increase in intra-financial system liabilities due to higher deposits, while intra-financial system assets decreased.\n\n4. **Substitutability/Financial Institution Infrastructure**: Assets under custody and payments activity have increased, reflecting the bank's significant role in market infrastructure.\n\n5. **Complexity**: The notional amount of OTC derivatives has risen, while trading and other securities have decreased, indicating changes in the bank's complexity.\n\nThe report also notes that the bank was designated as a G-SIB in 2019, requiring additional public disclosures. Changes in indicators primarily reflect normal business activities, and any revisions following regulatory reviews will be published on the bank's website."

        "summary": "The text provides a detailed overview of TD Bank's regulatory capital position as of January 31, 2022, under Basel III standards. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital**: Increased to $71.5 billion from $69.9 billion in October 2021, with a CET1 ratio of 15.2%, unchanged from the previous quarter. This stability is attributed to organic growth offset by share repurchases and risk-weighted asset (RWA) growth.\n\n2. **Tier 1 and Total Capital**: Tier 1 Capital rose to $76.9 billion, and Total Capital increased to $89.4 billion. The Tier 1 Capital ratio slightly decreased to 16.3% from 16.5%, while the Total Capital ratio decreased marginally to 19.0% from 19.1%.\n\n3. **Regulatory Adjustments**: Various deductions and adjustments were made to CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital, including goodwill, intangibles, and investments in financial entities.\n\n4. **Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)**: Increased to $470.9 billion, primarily due to growth in the Wholesale Banking and Canadian Retail segments.\n\n5. **Leverage Ratio**: Decreased to 4.4% from 4.8% in the previous quarter.\n\nOverall, TD Bank maintained a strong capital position with stable CET1 and Total Capital ratios, despite challenges such as share repurchases and RWA growth."

        "chunk": "In addition to the risks described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the Bank’s 2021 MD&A, there are numerous other risk factors, many of which are beyond the Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, that could cause the Bank’s results to differ significantly from its plans, objectives, and estimates or could impact the Bank’s reputation or sustainability of its business model. All forward-looking statements, including those in this MD&A, are, by their very nature, subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific, which may cause the Bank’s actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Some of these factors are discussed in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A and in this “Risk Factors and Management” section of this document, and others are noted in the “Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” section of this document. For a discussion of risk factors that could adversely affect the Bank’s financial results and condition, refer to the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A. The following risk factor supplements the “Impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic” risk factor described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A. Impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of additional variants that are potentially more contagious and/or more vaccine-resistant than current or past COVID-19 variants, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased levels of workforce absenteeism and disruption for the Bank and for its suppliers and other third parties upon which the Bank relies, which may increase operational and compliance risks for the Bank. Increased absenteeism and disruption may also increase the Bank’s exposure to the other risks described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A, including those set out in the “Impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic” risk factor. The following risk factor amends the ‘Ability to Attract, Develop, and Retain key Talent’ risk factor described in the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2021 MD&A. Ability to Attract, Develop, and Retain Key Talent The Bank’s future performance is dependent on the availability of qualified talent and the Bank’s ability to attract, develop, and retain key talent. The Bank’s management understands that the competition for talent continues to increase across geographies, industries, and emerging capabilities across a number of sectors including financial services. This competition has intensified and is expected to continue to intensify as a result of the impact of COVID-19, including as a result of remote work opportunities and relaxing geographic boundaries. This could result in increased attrition across organizations particularly in areas where core professional and specialized skills are required. Annually, the Bank undertakes a talent review process to assess critical capability requirements for all areas of the business. Through this process, an assessment of current executive leadership, technical and core capabilities, as well as talent development opportunities is completed against both near term and future business needs. The outcomes from the process inform plans at both the enterprise and business level to retain, develop, or acquire the talent which are then actioned throughout the course of the year. Although it is the goal of the Bank’s management resource policies and practices to attract, develop, and retain key talent employed by the Bank or an entity acquired by the Bank, the Bank may not be able to do so. The Bank continues to rely on the Bank’s annual talent review program as well as the Bank’s regular, effective management practices to proactively assess and address retention and recruitment risk and emphasize ongoing communication with talent to ensure appropriate responses on a case-by-case basis. Growing profitability in financial results based on balanced revenue, expense and capital growth services involves selectively taking and managing risks within the Bank’s risk appetite. The Bank’s goal is to earn a stable and sustainable rate of return for every dollar of risk it takes, while putting significant emphasis on investing in its businesses to meet its future strategic objectives. The Bank’s businesses and operations are exposed to a broad number of risks that have been identified and defined in the Enterprise Risk Framework. The Bank’s tolerance to those risks is defined in the Enterprise Risk Appetite which has been developed within a comprehensive framework that takes into consideration current conditions in which the Bank operates and the impact that emerging risks will have on TD’s strategy and risk profile. The Bank’s risk appetite states that it takes risks required to build its business, but only if those risks: (1) fit the business strategy and can be understood and managed; (2) do not expose the enterprise to any significant single loss events; TD does not ‘bet the bank’ on any single acquisition, business, or product; and (3) do not risk harming the TD brand. Each business is responsible for setting and aligning its individual risk appetites with that of the enterprise based on a thorough examination of the specific risks to which it is exposed. The Bank considers it critical to regularly assess its operating environment and highlight top and emerging risks. These are risks with a potential to have a material effect on the Bank and where the attention of senior leaders is focused due to the potential magnitude or immediacy of their impact. Risks are identified, discussed, and actioned by senior leaders and reported quarterly to the Risk Committee. Specific plans to mitigate top and emerging risks are prepared, monitored, and adjusted as required. The Bank’s risk governance structure and risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. Additional information on risk factors can be found in this document and the 2021 MD&A under the heading “Risk Factors and Management”. For a complete discussion of the risk governance structure and the risk management approach, refer to the “Managing Risk” section in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. The shaded sections of this MD&A represent a discussion relating to market and liquidity risks and form an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended January 31, 2022.

        "chunk": "Calculating VaR The Bank computes total VaR on a daily basis by combining the General Market Risk (GMR) and Idiosyncratic Debt Specific Risk (IDSR) associated with the Bank’s trading positions. GMR is determined by creating a distribution of potential changes in the market value of the current portfolio using historical simulation. The Bank values the current portfolio using the market price and rate changes of the most recent 259 trading days for equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity products. GMR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. A one-day holding period is used for GMR calculation, which is scaled up to ten days for regulatory capital calculation purposes. IDSR measures idiosyncratic (single-name) credit spread risk for credit exposures in the trading portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. The IDSR model is based on the historical behaviour of five-year idiosyncratic credit spreads. Similar to GMR, IDSR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. IDSR is measured for a ten-day holding period. The following graph discloses daily one-day VaR usage and trading net revenue, reported on a taxable equivalent basis, within Wholesale Banking. Trading net revenue includes trading income and net interest income related to positions within the Bank’s market risk capital trading books. For the quarter ending January 31, 2022, there were 7 days of trading losses and trading net revenue was positive for 89% of the trading days, reflecting normal trading activity. Losses in the quarter did not exceed VaR on any trading day.

The Bank continuously improves its VaR methodologies and incorporates new risk measures in line with market conventions, industry best practices, and regulatory requirements. To mitigate some of the shortcomings of VaR, the Bank uses additional metrics designed for risk management and capital purposes. These include Stressed VaR, IRC, Stress Testing Framework, as well as limits based on the sensitivity to various market risk factors. Calculating Stressed VaR In addition to VaR, the Bank also calculates Stressed VaR, which includes Stressed GMR and Stressed IDSR. Stressed VaR is designed to measure the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of stressed market conditions. Stressed VaR is determined using similar techniques and assumptions in GMR and IDSR VaR. However, instead of using the most recent 259 trading days (one year), the Bank uses a selected year of stressed market conditions. In the first quarter of 2022, Stressed VaR was calculated using the one-year period that includes the 2008 financial crisis. The appropriate historical one-year period to use for Stressed VaR is determined on a quarterly basis. Stressed VaR is a part of regulatory capital requirements. Calculating the Incremental Risk Charge The IRC is applied to all instruments in the trading book subject to migration and default risk. Migration risk represents the risk of changes in the credit ratings of the Bank’s exposures. TD applies a Monte Carlo simulation with a one-year horizon and a 99.9% confidence level to determine IRC, which is consistent with regulatory requirements. IRC is based on a “constant level of risk” assumption, which requires banks to assign a liquidity horizon to positions that are subject to IRC. IRC is a part of regulatory capital requirements.",

It is not meaningful to compute a diversification effect because the high and low may occur on different days for different risk types. Average VaR increased quarter-over-quarter due to changes in interest rate risk positions and decreased year-over-year due to the COVID-19 related VaR scenarios dropping out of the one-year historical VaR period. Average Stressed VaR increased compared to both last quarter and same quarter last year due to changes in interest rate risk positions. Average IRC remained relatively unchanged compared to last quarter. Average IRC decreased year-over-year due to changes in bond positions. Validation of VaR Model The Bank uses a back-testing process to compare the actual and theoretical profit and losses to VaR to ensure that they are consistent with the statistical results of the VaR model. The theoretical profit or loss is generated using the daily price movements on the assumption that there is no change in the composition of the portfolio. Validation of the IRC model must follow a different approach since the one-year horizon and 99.9% confidence level preclude standard back-testing techniques. Instead, key parameters of the IRC model such as transition and correlation matrices are subject to independent validation by benchmarking against external study results or through analysis using internal or external data. Structural (Non-Trading) Interest Rate Risk The Bank’s structural interest rate risk arises from traditional personal and commercial banking activity and is generally the result of mismatches between the maturities and repricing dates of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. The measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book does not include exposures from TD’s Wholesale Banking or Insurance businesses. The primary measures for this risk are Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS). The EVE Sensitivity measures the impact of a specified interest rate shock to the change in the net present value of the Bank’s banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items. It reflects a measurement of the potential present value impact on shareholders’ equity without an assumed term profile for the management of the Bank’s own equity and excludes product margins. The NIIS measures the NII change over a twelve-month horizon for a specified change in interest rates for banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off- balance sheet items assuming a constant balance sheet over the period. The Bank’s Market Risk policy sets overall limits on the structural interest rate risk measures. These limits are periodically reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee. In addition to the Board policy limits, book-level risk limits are set for the Bank’s management of non-trading interest rate risk by Risk Management. Exposures against these limits are routinely monitored and reported, and breaches of the Board limits, if any, are escalated to both the Asset/Liability and Capital Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee. The following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rates on the EVE and NIIS measures. Interest rate floors are applied by currency to the decrease in rates such that they do not exceed expected lower bounds, with the most material currencies set to a floor of -25 bps.

As at January 31, 2022, an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase in interest rates would have had a negative impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,284 million, a decrease of $84 million from last quarter, and a positive impact to the Bank’s NII of $2,000 million, an increase of $143 million from last quarter. An immediate and sustained 100 bps decrease in interest rates would have had a positive impact to the Bank’s EVE of $543 million, an increase of $205 million from last quarter, and a negative impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,481 million, an increase of $380 million from last quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in up shock EVE is primarily due to decreased sensitivity from loan optionality in the U.S. region. The quarter-over-quarter increase in down shock NII Sensitivity in primarily due to an increase in the effective shock given the increased level of rates and the measurement using a -25 bps floor, while the increase in up shock NII Sensitivity is primarily attributed to deposit growth.

Financial obligations can arise from deposit withdrawals, debt maturities, commitments to provide credit or liquidity support, or the need to pledge additional collateral. TD’S LIQUIDITY RISK APPETITE The Bank maintains a prudent and disciplined approach to managing its potential exposure to liquidity risk. The Bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under a combined bank-specific and market-wide stress scenario, and a minimum buffer over regulatory requirements prescribed by OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) guidelines. Under the LAR guidelines, Canadian banks are required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at the minimum of 100% other than during periods of financial stress and to maintain a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at the minimum of 100%. The Bank’s funding program emphasizes maximizing deposits as a core source of funding, and having ready access to wholesale funding markets across diversified terms, funding types, and currencies that is designed to ensure low exposure to a sudden contraction of wholesale funding capacity and to minimize structural liquidity gaps. The Bank also maintains a contingency funding plan to enhance preparedness for recovery from potential liquidity stress events. The Bank’s strategies and actions comprise an integrated liquidity risk management program that is designed to ensure low exposure to liquidity risk and compliance with regulatory requirements. The Bank’s ALCO oversees the Bank’s liquidity risk management program. It ensures there are effective management structures and practices in place to properly measure and manage liquidity risk. The Global Liquidity & Funding Committee, a subcommittee of the ALCO comprised of senior management from Treasury and Balance Sheet Management (TBSM), Risk Management and Wholesale Banking, identifies and monitors the Bank’s liquidity risks. The management of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the SET member responsible for TBSM, while oversight and challenge is provided by the ALCO and independently by Risk Management. The Risk Committee regularly reviews the Bank’s liquidity position and approves the Bank’s Liquidity Risk Management Framework bi-annually and the related policies annually. The Bank has established TDGUS as TD’s U.S. Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), as well as a Combined U.S. Operations (CUSO) reporting unit that consists of the IHC and TD’s U.S. branch and agency network. Both TDGUS and CUSO are managed to the U.S. Enhanced Prudential Standards liquidity requirements in addition to the Bank’s liquidity management framework. The Bank’s liquidity risk appetite and liquidity risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. For a complete discussion of liquidity risk, refer to the “Liquidity Risk” section in the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report. Liquid assets The unencumbered liquid assets the Bank holds to meet its liquidity requirements must be high-quality securities that the Bank believes can be monetized quickly in stress conditions with minimum loss in market value. The liquidity value of unencumbered liquid assets considers estimated market or trading depths, settlement timing, and/or other identified impediments to potential sale or pledging. Overall, the Bank expects any reduction in market value of its liquid asset portfolio to be modest given the underlying high credit quality and demonstrated liquidity. Assets held by the Bank to meet liquidity requirements are summarized in the following tables. The tables do not include assets held within the Bank’s insurance businesses as these are used to support insurance-specific liabilities and capital requirements. Page 31",

Where a particular asset has been encumbered and TD has holdings of the asset both on-balance sheet and off- balance sheet, for the purpose of this disclosure, the on- and off-balance sheet holdings are encumbered in alignment with the business practice. 2 Assets received as collateral through off-balance transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, margin loans, and other client activity. 3 Represents assets that have been posted externally to support the Bank’s day-to-day operations, including securities financing transactions, clearing and payments, and derivative transactions. Also includes assets that have been pledged supporting Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) activity. 4 Assets supporting TD’s long-term funding activities, assets pledged against securitization liabilities, and assets held by consolidated securitization vehicles or in pools for covered bond issuance. 5 Assets that are considered readily available in their current legal form to generate funding or support collateral needs. This category includes reported FHLB assets that remain unutilized and DSAC that are available for collateral purposes however not regularly utilized in practice. 6 Assets that cannot be used to support funding or collateral requirements in their current form. This category includes those assets that are potentially eligible as funding program collateral or for pledging to central banks (for example, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation insured mortgages that can b e securitized into NHA MBS). 7 Includes trading loans, securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL and other financial assets designated at FVTPL, financial assets at FVOCI, and DSAC. 8 Assets reported in the “Bank-owned assets” column represent the value of the loans extended and not the value of the collateral received. The loan value from the reverse repurchase transactions is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” co lumn to avoid double-counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 9 The loan value from the margin loans/client activity is deducted from the “Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double- counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 10 Other assets include investment in Schwab, goodwill, other intangibles, land, buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets, deferred tax assets, amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, and other assets on the balance sheet not reported in the above categories. In addition to the Severe Combined Stress Scenario, the Bank performs liquidity stress testing on multiple alternate scenarios. These scenarios are a mix of TD- specific events and market-wide stress events designed to test the impact from risk factors material to the Bank’s risk profile. Liquidity assessments are also part of the Bank’s Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing program. The Bank has liquidity contingency funding plans (CFP) in place at the overall Bank level and for subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions (“Regional CFPs”). The Bank’s CFP provides a documented framework for managing unexpected liquidity situations and thus is an integral component of the Bank’s overall liquidity risk management program. It outlines different contingency levels based on the severity and duration of the liquidity situation, and identifies recovery actions appropriate for each level. For each recovery action, it provides key operational steps required to execute the action. Regional CFPs identify recovery actions to address region-specific stress events. The actions and governance structure outlined in the Bank’s CFP are aligned with the Bank’s Crisis Management Recovery Plan. TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 34",

Rating downgrades could potentially result in higher financing costs, increased requirements to pledge collateral, reduced access to capital markets, and could also affect the Bank’s ability to enter into derivative transactions. Credit ratings and outlooks provided by rating agencies reflect their views and are subject to change from time-to-time, based on a number of factors including the Bank’s financial strength, competitive position, and liquidity, as well as factors not entirely within the Bank’s control, including the methodologies used by rating agencies and conditions affecting the overall financial services industry.

The Bank regularly reviews the level of increased collateral its trading counterparties would require in the event of a downgrade of TD’s credit rating. The Bank holds liquid assets to ensure it is able to provide additional collateral required by trading counterparties in the event of a three-notch downgrade in the Bank’s legacy senior debt ratings. The following table presents the additional collateral that could have been contractually required to be posted to OTC derivative counterparties as of the reporting date in the event of one, two, and three-notch downgrades of the Bank’s credit ratings.

The LCR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of the stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) over the net cash outflow requirements in the next 30 days under a hypothetical liquidity stress event. Other than during periods of financial stress, the Bank must maintain the LCR above 100% in accordance with the OSFI LAR requirement. The Bank’s LCR is calculated according to the scenario parameters in the LAR guideline, including prescribed HQLA eligibility criteria and haircuts, deposit run-off rates, and other outflow and inflow rates. HQLA held by the Bank that are eligible for the LCR calculation under the LAR are primarily central bank reserves, sovereign-issued or sovereign-guaranteed securities, and high-quality securities issued by non-financial entities.

These activities include clearing, custody, or cash management services. 7 Includes uncommitted credit and liquidity facilities, stable value money market mutual funds, outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, and other contractual cash outflows. With respect to outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, TD has no contractual obligation to buy back these outstanding TD debt securities, and as a result, a 0% outflow rate is applied under the OSFI LAR guideline. 8 Total HQLA includes both asset haircuts and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (HQLA assets after haircuts are capped at 40% for Level 2 and 15% for Level 2B). 9 Total Net Cash Outflows include both inflow and outflow rates and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (inflows are capped at 75% of outflows). The Bank’s average LCR of 124% for quarter ended January 31, 2022 continues to meet the regulatory requirements. The Bank holds a variety of liquid assets commensurate with liquidity needs of the organization. Many of these assets qualify as HQLA under the OSFI LAR guideline. The average HQLA of the Bank for the quarter ended January 31, 2022 was $327 billion (October 31, 2021 – $334 billion), with Level 1 assets representing 84% (October 31, 2021 – 86%). The Bank’s reported HQLA excludes excess HQLA from the U.S. Retail operations, as required by the OSFI LAR guideline, to reflect liquidity transfer considerations between U.S. Retail and its affiliates as a result of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s regulations. By excluding excess HQLA, the U.S. Retail LCR is effectively capped at 100% prior to total Bank consolidation. As described in the “How TD Manages Liquidity Risk” section of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report, the Bank manages its HQLA and other liquidity buffers to the higher of TD’s 90-day surplus requirement and the target buffers over regulatory requirements from the LCR, NSFR, and the Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) metrics. As a result, the total stock of HQLA is subject to ongoing rebalancing against the projected liquidity requirements. The NSFR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of total available stable funding (ASF) over total required stable funding (RSF) in accordance with OSFI’s LAR guideline. The Bank must maintain an NSFR ratio equal to or above 100% in accordance with the LAR guideline. The Bank’s ASF comprises the Bank’s liability and capital instruments (including but not limited to deposits and wholesale funding). The Bank’s RSF comprises the Bank’s assets and off-balance sheet activities and is a function of the liquidity characteristics and maturity profile of these assets.

The Bank's HQLA primarily consists of Level 1 assets, representing 84% of the total. The report also notes that excess HQLA from U.S. Retail operations is excluded due to regulatory considerations. The Bank's liquidity management strategy involves maintaining a balance between projected liquidity needs and regulatory requirements, including the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which must be at least 100%.

Interdependent liabilities cannot fall due while asset is still on balance sheet, cannot be used to fund any other assets and principal payments from the asset cannot be used for anything other than repaying the liability. As such, the only interdependent assets and liabilities that qualify for this treatment at the Bank are the liabilities arising from the Ca nada Mortgage Bonds Program and their corresponding encumbered assets. 6 Includes Residential Mortgages and HELOCs. The Bank’s NSFR for the quarter ended January 31, 2022 is at 124% (October 31, 2021 – 125%) and has met the regulatory requirements. The NSFR changes quarter-to-quarter are based on a number of factors including deposit and loan growth, changes in capital levels, wholesale funding issuance and maturities, and changes in the maturity profile of wholesale funding.

        "summary": "The text provides a detailed breakdown of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for a financial institution as of January 31, 2022, with a comparison to October 31, 2021. The NSFR is a measure of a bank's liquidity, ensuring it has enough stable funding to cover its long-term assets. As of January 31, 2022, the NSFR is 124%, slightly down from 125% on October 31, 2021, but still above regulatory requirements. The report details various components of available and required stable funding, including capital, retail and wholesale deposits, and performing loans. Changes in the NSFR are attributed to factors such as deposit and loan growth, capital level changes, and the maturity profile of wholesale funding. The bank has met the regulatory requirements for NSFR, indicating a stable liquidity position."

        "chunk": "The Bank has access to a variety of unsecured and secured funding sources. The Bank’s funding activities are conducted in accordance with the liquidity management policy that requires assets be funded to the appropriate term and to a prudent diversification profile. The Bank’s primary approach to managing funding activities is to maximize the use of deposits raised through personal and commercial banking channels. The following table illustrates the Bank’s large base of personal and commercial, wealth, and Schwab sweep deposits (collectively, “P&C deposits”) that make up over 75% of the Bank’s total funding. TABLE 40: SUMMARY OF DEPOSIT FUNDING (millions of Canadian dollars) As at January 31 2022 October 31 2021 P&C deposits – Canadian Retail $ 525,646 $ 519,466 P&C deposits – U.S. Retail1 492,382 472,742 Total $ 1,018,028 $ 992,208 1 P&C deposits in U.S. Retail are presented on a CAD equivalent basis and therefore period-over-period movements reflect both underlying growth and changes in the foreign exchange rate. The Bank maintains various registered external wholesale term (greater than 1 year) funding programs to provide access to diversified funding sources, including asset securitization, covered bonds, and unsecured wholesale debt. The Bank raises term funding through Senior Notes, NHA MBS, and notes backed by credit card receivables (Evergreen Credit Card Trust) and home equity lines of credit (Genesis Trust II). The Bank’s wholesale funding is diversified by geography, by currency, and by funding types. The Bank raises short-term (1 year and less) funding using certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and bankers’ acceptances. The following table summarizes the registered term funding and capital programs by geography, with the related program size as at January 31, 2022. Canada United States Europe Capital Securities Program ($15 billion) Canadian Senior Medium-Term Linked Notes Program ($4 billion) HELOC ABS Program (Genesis Trust II) ($7 billion) U.S. SEC (F-3) Registered Capital and Debt Program (US$45 billion)1 United Kingdom Listing Authority (UKLA) Registered Legislative Covered Bond Program ($80 billion) UKLA Registered European Medium-Term Note Program (US$20 billion) 1 On February 4, 2022, the Bank filed a renewal registration statement on Form F-3 which, subject to review by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission and upon going effective, would register up to US$75 billion for sale under the U.S. program. The following table presents a breakdown of the Bank’s term debt by currency and funding type. Term funding as at January 31, 2022, was $104.5 billion (October 31, 2021 – $100.7 billion). Note that Table 41: Long-Term Funding and Table 42: Wholesale Funding do not include any funding accessed via repurchase transactions or securities financing.

The Bank maintains depositor concentration limits in respect of short-term wholesale deposits so that it is not overly reliant on individual depositors for funding. The Bank further limits short-term wholesale funding maturity concentration in an effort to mitigate refinancing risk during a stress event.

        "summary": "The text outlines the Bank's funding strategy, emphasizing a diversified approach to liquidity management. The Bank primarily relies on personal and commercial banking deposits, which constitute over 75% of its total funding. As of January 31, 2022, these deposits amounted to CAD 1,018,028 million, showing growth from October 31, 2021. The Bank also utilizes various wholesale funding programs, including asset securitization, covered bonds, and unsecured debt, diversified by geography and currency. Long-term funding is primarily in Canadian and U.S. dollars, with senior unsecured medium-term notes being the largest funding type.

Excludes $1.3 billion of structured notes subject to conversion under the “bail-in” regime (October 31, 2021 – $1.4 billion). 6 Subordinated notes and debentures are not considered wholesale funding as they may be raised primarily for capital management purposes. 7 Includes fixed-term deposits from non-bank institutions (unsecured) of $19.1 billion (October 31, 2021 – $14.6 billion) and the remaining are non-term deposits. Excluding the Wholesale Banking residential mortgage trading business, the Bank’s total mortgage-backed securities issued to external investors for the three months ended January 31, 2022 was $0.4 billion (three months ended January 31, 2021 – $0.5 billion) and other asset-backed securities issued for the three months ended January 31, 2022 was nil (three months ended January 31, 2021 – nil). The Bank also issued $7.8 billion of unsecured medium-term notes for the three months ended January 31, 2022 (three months ended January 31, 2021 – $5.6 billion). In January 2022, OSFI published finalized updates to its Liquidity Adequacy Requirements guideline, following a public consultation period that began in March 2021. The primary changes to the LAR involve enhancements to the NCCF supervisory tool to improve the risk sensitivity to the metric. Significant changes include the addition of contingencies for undrawn loan commitments, changes to certain loan cash inflows, and the adjustment of deposit runoff factors. The effective date of the changes will be April 2023. In January 2022, OSFI published an updated Pillar 3 Disclosure Guideline, which covers liquidity disclosures among other topics. The guideline provides OSFI’s updated expectations for the domestic implementation of Basel’s Pillar 3 Framework. The guideline will not materially impact the Bank’s existing liquidity disclosures, but will contribute to improved consistency and comparability of disclosures across jurisdictions. The effective date of the changes will be in the second quarter of 2023. MATURITY ANALYSIS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet categories by remaining contractual maturity. Off-balance sheet commitments include contractual obligations to make future payments on certain lease-related commitments, certain purchase obligations, and other liabilities. The values of credit instruments reported in the following table represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the Bank could be obligated to extend should such instruments be fully drawn or utilized. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contractual amounts is not representative of expected future liquidity requirements. These contractual obligations have an impact on the Bank’s short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The maturity analysis presented does not depict the degree of the Bank’s maturity transformation or the Bank’s exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk. The Bank ensures that assets are appropriately funded to protect against borrowing cost volatility and potential reductions to funding market availability. The Bank utilizes stable non-maturity deposits (chequing and savings accounts) and term deposits as the primary source of long-term funding for the Bank’s non-trading assets including personal and business term loans and the stable balance of revolving lines of credit. The Bank issues long-term funding based primarily on the projected net growth of non-trading assets and raises short term funding primarily to finance trading assets. The liquidity of trading assets under stressed market conditions is considered when determining the appropriate term of the funding.

        "chunk": "SECURITIZATION AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Bank enters into securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations. The Bank is involved with structured entities (SEs) that it sponsors, as well as entities sponsored by third parties. Refer to “Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section, Note 9: Transfers of Financial Assets and Note 10: Structured Entities of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Report and “Transfers of Financial Assets Qualifying for Derecognition” section of Note 6 of the Bank’s first quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s securitization and off- balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended January 31, 2022. Securitization of Bank-Originated Assets The Bank securitizes residential mortgages, personal loans, credit cards and business and government loans to enhance its liquidity position, to diversify sources of funding, and to optimize the management of the balance sheet. Residential Mortgage Loans The Bank securitizes residential mortgage loans through significant consolidated and unconsolidated SEs and Canadian non-SE third parties. Residential mortgage loans securitized by the Bank may give rise to full derecognition of the financial assets depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In instances where the Bank fully derecognizes residential mortgage loans, the Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through retained interests. Consumer Instalment and Other Personal Loans The Bank securitizes consumer instalment and other personal loans through a consolidated SE. The Bank consolidates the SE as it serves as a financing vehicle for the Bank’s assets, the Bank has power over the key economic decisions of the SE, and the Bank is exposed to the majority of the residual risks of the SE. Credit Card Loans The Bank securitizes credit card loans through an SE. The Bank consolidates the SE as it serves as a financing vehicle for the Bank’s assets, the Bank has power over the key economic decisions of the SE, and the Bank is exposed to the majority of the residual risks of the SE. Business and Government Loans The Bank securitizes business and government loans through significant unconsolidated SEs and Canadian non-SE third parties. Business and government loans securitized by the Bank may be derecognized from the Bank’s balance sheet depending on the individual arrangement of each transaction. In instances where the Bank fully derecognizes business and government loans, the Bank may be exposed to the risks of transferred loans through retained interests. There are no ECLs on the retained interests of the securitized business and government loans as the mortgages are all government insured. Securitization of Third Party-Originated Assets Significant Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities The Bank securitizes third party-originated assets through Bank-sponsored SEs, including its Canadian multi-seller conduits which are not consolidated. These Canadian multi-seller conduits securitize Canadian originated third-party assets. The Bank administers these multi-seller conduits and provides liquidity facilities as well as securities distribution services; it may also provide credit enhancements. TD’s maximum potential exposure to loss due to its ownership interest in commercial paper and through the provision of liquidity facilities for multi-seller conduits was $10.8 billion as at January 31, 2022 (October 31, 2021 – $10.5 billion). In addition, as at January 31, 2022, the Bank had committed to provide $3.0 billion in liquidity facilities that can be used to support future asset- backed commercial paper in the purchase of deal-specific assets (October 31, 2021 – $2.1 billion). Off-Balance Sheet Exposure to Third Party-Sponsored Conduits The Bank has off-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits arising from providing liquidity facilities and funding commitments of $3.1 billion as at January 31, 2022 (October 31, 2021 – $2.5 billion). The assets within these conduits are comprised of individual notes backed by automotive loan receivables, credit card receivables, equipment receivables and trade receivables. On-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits have been included in the financial statements. The Bank’s unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. For details of the Bank’s accounting policies under IFRS, refer to Note 2 of the Bank’s first quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. For details of the Bank’s significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions under IFRS, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s first quarter 2022 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no new accounting policies that have been adopted by the Bank for the three months ended January 31, 2022. ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The ECL model requires the application of estimates and judgment in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. As a result of COVID-19, there is a higher degree of uncertainty in determining reasonable and supportable forward-looking information. Management exercises expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date, by considering reasonable and supportable information that is not already included in the quantitative models. The current environment is subject to rapid change and to the extent that certain effects of COVID-19 are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, increased temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. This includes borrower credit scores, industry and geography specific COVID-19 impacts, payment support initiatives TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 42",
        "summary": "The text discusses the Bank's involvement in securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements, which are part of its regular operations. The Bank engages with structured entities (SEs) it sponsors and those sponsored by third parties, with no significant changes reported for the quarter ending January 31, 2022. The Bank securitizes various assets, including residential mortgages, personal loans, credit card loans, and business and government loans, to enhance liquidity, diversify funding sources, and optimize balance sheet management. Some of these securitizations result in full derecognition of assets, although the Bank may retain exposure to risks through retained interests. The Bank also securitizes third-party originated assets through unconsolidated SEs and provides liquidity facilities and credit enhancements. As of January 31, 2022, the Bank's maximum potential exposure to loss from these activities was $10.8 billion, with additional commitments of $3.0 billion in liquidity facilities. The Bank's off-balance sheet exposure to third-party sponsored conduits was $3.1 billion. The Bank's financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, with no new accounting policies adopted for the quarter. The text also highlights the importance of accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions, particularly in the context of the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model, which requires significant judgment due to the uncertainties introduced by COVID-19."

The Bank has performed certain additional qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Effective December 31, 2021, the publication of London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and euro settings as well as the 1-week and 2-month US LIBOR settings. The Bank continues to progress on its transition plan for the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month US LIBOR settings which will cease to be published immediately after June 30, 2023. On January 31, 2022, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Ltd. (RBSL), the administrator of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), published a public consultation regarding the potential cessation of CDOR. Following the consultation close on February 28, 2022, RBSL is expected to publish an outcome statement on the consultation. Pending any decision yet to be taken by RBSL, the outcome statement may include an announcement of the cessation of CDOR together with an effective date for such cessation. The consultation followed the publication of a whitepaper regarding the future of CDOR by the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) on December 16, 2021, which recommended RBSL cease publication of all CDOR’s remaining tenors after June 30, 2024. CARR emphasized that the decision to cease CDOR ultimately lies with RBSL as the administrator of CDOR. The following standard has been issued, but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of applying the standard on the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and will adopt the standard when it becomes effective. TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the Bank. OSFI’s related Advisory precludes early adoption. The standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The Bank is proceeding with the implementation efforts accordingly. During the most recent interim period, there have been no changes in the Bank’s policies and procedures and other processes that comprise its internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting.

        "chunk": "Financial and Banking Terms Adjusted Results: Non-GAAP financial measures used to assess each of the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note”, from reported results. The items of note relate to items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance. Allowance for Credit Losses: Represent expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. Allowance for credit losses consists of Stage 3 allowance for impaired financial assets and Stage 2 and Stage 1 allowance for performing financial assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals, and impacted by foreign exchange. Amortized Cost: The amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization, using EIRM, of any differences between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. Assets under Administration (AUA): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers where the Bank provides services of an administrative nature, such as the collection of investment income and the placing of trades on behalf of the clients (where the client has made his or her own investment selection). The majority of these assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets under Management (AUM): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers, managed by the Bank, where the Bank has discretion to make investment selections on behalf of the client (in accordance with an investment policy). In addition to the TD family of mutual funds, the Bank manages assets on behalf of individuals, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments and foundations. These assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Some assets under management that are also administered by the Bank are included in assets under administration. Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP): A form of commercial paper that is collateralized by other financial assets. Institutional investors usually purchase such instruments in order to diversify their assets and generate short-term gains. Asset-Backed Securities (ABS): A security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or “backed”) by a specified pool of underlying assets. Average Common Equity: Average common equity for the business segments reflects the average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Average Interest-Earning Assets: A non-GAAP financial measure that depicts the Bank’s financial position, and is calculated as the average carrying value of deposits with banks, loans and securities based on daily balances for the period ending October 31 in each fiscal year. Basic Earnings per Share (EPS): A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted basic EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Basis Points (bps): A unit equal to 1/100 of 1%. Thus, a 1% change is equal to 100 basis points. Book Value per Share: A measure calculated by dividing common shareholders’ equity by number of common shares at the end of the period. Carrying Value: The value at which an asset or liability is carried at on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO): They are collateralized debt obligations consisting of mortgage-backed securities that are separated and issued as different classes of mortgage pass-through securities with different terms, interest rates, and risks. CMOs by private issuers are collectively referred to as non-agency CMOs. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: This is a primary Basel III capital measure comprised mainly of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. Regulatory deductions made to arrive at the CET1 Capital include goodwill and intangibles, unconsolidated investments in banking, financial, and insurance entities, deferred tax assets, defined benefit pension fund assets, and shortfalls in allowances. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio: CET1 Capital ratio represents the predominant measure of capital adequacy under Basel III and equals CET1 Capital divided by RWA. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): A measure of growth over multiple time periods from the initial investment value to the ending investment value assuming that the investment has been compounding over the time period. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA): CVA represents a capital charge that measures credit risk due to default of derivative counterparties. This charge requires banks to capitalize for the potential changes in counterparty credit spread for the derivative portfolios. Diluted EPS: A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusting for the effect of all potentially dilutive common shares. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Payout Ratio: A ratio represents the percentage of Bank’s earnings being paid to common shareholders in the form of dividends and is calculated by dividing common dividends by net income available to common shareholders. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Yield: A ratio calculated as the dividend per common share for the year divided by the daily average closing stock price during the year. Effective Income Tax Rate: A rate and performance indicator calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes as a percentage of net income before taxes. Adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated in the same manner using adjusted results. Effective Interest Rate (EIR): The rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The calculation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts. Effective Interest Rate Method (EIRM): A technique for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument’s book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Under EIRM, the effective interest rate, which is a key component of the calculation, discounts the expected future cash inflows and outflows expected over the life of a financial instrument.

A lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted non-interest expenses and total revenue. Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF): Established by the Financial Stability Board in May 2012, comprised of banks, analysts, investors, and auditors, with the goal of enhancing the risk disclosures of banks and other financial institutions. Expected Credit Losses (ECLs): ECLs are the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions that impact the Bank’s credit risk assessment. Fair Value: The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Under IFRS 9, if the asset passes the contractual cash flows test (named SPPI), the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classified. If the instrument is being held to collect contractual cash flows, that is, if it is not expected to be sold, it is measured as amortized cost. If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is measured at FVOCI. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Under IFRS 9, the classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI) and a business model assessment. Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in profit or loss. TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): A U.S. government corporation which provides deposit insurance guaranteeing the safety of a depositor’s accounts in member banks. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in receiverships (failed banks). Forward Contracts: Over-the-counter contracts between two parties that oblige one party to the contract to buy and the other party to sell an asset for a fixed price at a future date. Futures: Exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Hedging: A risk management technique intended to mitigate the Bank’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other market factors. The elimination or reduction of such exposure is accomplished by engaging in capital markets activities to establish offsetting positions. Impaired Loans: Loans where, in management’s opinion, there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent that the Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. Loss Given Default (LGD): It is the amount of the loss the Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a loan, which is expressed as a percentage of exposure at default. Mark-to-Market (MTM): A valuation that reflects current market rates as at the balance sheet date for financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Master Netting Agreements: Legal agreements between two parties that have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default or termination of any one contract. Net Corporate Expenses: Non-interest expenses related to corporate service and control groups which are not allocated to a business segment. Net Interest Margin: A non-GAAP ratio calculated as net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to measure performance. This metric is an indicator of the profitability of the Bank’s earning assets less the cost of funding. Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC): Instruments (preferred shares and subordinated debt) that contain a feature or a provision that allows the financial institution to either permanently convert these instruments into common shares or fully write-down the instrument, in the event that the institution is no longer viable. Notional: A reference amount on which payments for derivative financial instruments are based. Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI): The regulator of Canadian federally chartered financial institutions and federally administered pension plans. Options: Contracts in which the writer of the option grants the buyer the future right, but not the obligation, to buy or to sell a security, exchange rate, interest rate, or other financial instrument or commodity at a predetermined price at or by a specified future date. Price-Earnings Ratio: A ratio calculated by dividing the closing share price by EPS based on a trailing four quarters to indicate market performance. Adjusted price-earnings ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted EPS. Probability of Default (PD): It is the likelihood that a borrower will not be able to meet its scheduled repayments. Provision for Credit Losses (PCL): Amount added to the allowance for credit losses to bring it to a level that management considers adequate to reflect expected credit-related losses on its portfolio. Return on Common Equity (ROE): The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity, utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. Adjusted ROE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Return on Risk-weighted Assets: Net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average risk-weighted assets. Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a percentage of average Tangible common equity. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Both measures can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA): Assets calculated by applying a regulatory risk-weight factor to on and off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight factors are established by the OSFI to convert on and off-balance sheet exposures to a comparable risk level. Page 45",

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Securitization: The process by which financial assets, mainly loans, are transferred to structures, which normally issue a series of asset-backed securities to investors to fund the purchase of loans. Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI): IFRS 9 requires that the following criteria be met in order for a financial instrument to be classified at amortized cost:  The entity’s business model relates to managing financial assets (such as bank trading activity), and, as such, an asset is held with the intention of collecting its contractual cash flows; and  An asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI. Swaps: Contracts that involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest rate payment obligations and currencies on a notional principal for a specified period of time. Tangible common equity (TCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as common shareholders’ equity less goodwill, imputed goodwill, and intangibles on an investment in Schwab and TD Ameritrade and other acquired intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. It can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Taxable Equivalent Basis (TEB): A calculation method (not defined in GAAP) that increases revenues and the provision for income taxes on certain tax- exempt securities to an equivalent before-tax basis to facilitate comparison of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Tier 1 Capital Ratio: Tier 1 Capital represents the more permanent forms of capital, consisting primarily of common shareholders’ equity, retained earnings, preferred shares and innovative instruments. Tier 1 Capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 Capital divided by RWA. Total Capital Ratio: Total Capital is defined as the total of net Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital. Total Capital ratio is calculated as Total Capital divided by RWA. Total Shareholder Return (TSR): The change in market price plus dividends paid during the year as a percentage of the prior year’s closing market price per common share. Trading-Related Revenue: A non-GAAP financial measure that is the total of trading income (loss), net interest income on trading positions, and income from financial instruments designated at FVTPL that are managed within a trading portfolio. Trading-related revenue (TEB) in the Wholesale Banking segment, which is part of the total Bank’s trading-related revenue, is also a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated in the same manner, including TEB adjustments. Both are used for measuring trading performance. Value-at-Risk (VaR): A metric used to monitor and control overall risk levels and to calculate the regulatory capital required for market risk in trading activities. VaR measures the adverse impact that potential changes in market rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of time. Page 46",

Preferred shares remained stable at $5,700 million.\n\n2. **Retained Earnings**: Retained earnings grew from $63,944 million to $65,621 million, supported by net income of $3,733 million, offset by dividends and share repurchases.\n\n3. **Comprehensive Income**: Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased from $11,152 million to $7,532 million, influenced by losses in financial assets and derivatives, partially offset by foreign currency translation gains.\n\n4. **Cash Flows**: Operating activities generated $28,747 million in cash, a decrease from the previous year. Financing activities used $4,794 million, primarily due to share repurchases and dividend payments. Investing activities used $22,989 million, with significant purchases of debt securities.\n\n5. **Liquidity**: Cash and due from banks increased to $7,001 million from $5,931 million at the beginning of the period.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group experienced growth in retained earnings and maintained strong operating cash flows, despite challenges in comprehensive income and significant investment outflows."

        "chunk": "NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) NOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS The Toronto-Dominion Bank is a bank chartered under the Bank Act. The shareholders of a bank are not, as shareholders, liable for any liability, act, or default of the bank except as otherwise provided under the Bank Act. The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”). The Bank was formed through the amalgamation on February 1, 1955, of The Bank of Toronto (chartered in 1855) and The Dominion Bank (chartered in 1869). The Bank is incorporated and domiciled in Canada with its registered and principal business offices located at 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario. TD serves customers in three business segments operating in a number of locations in key financial centres around the globe: Canadian Retail, U.S. Retail, and Wholesale Banking. The accompanying Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting principles followed by the Bank have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including the accounting requirements of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. These Interim Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on a condensed basis in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting using the accounting policies as described in Note 2 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain comparative amounts have been revised to conform with the presentation adopted in the current period. The preparation of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements requires that management make judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as further described in Note 3 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 3 of this report. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future confirming events occur. The Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. All intercompany transactions, balances, and unrealized gains and losses on transactions are eliminated on consolidation. The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended January 31, 2022, were approved and authorized for issue by the Bank’s Board of Directors, in accordance with a recommendation of the Audit Committee, on March 2, 2022. As the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the disclosures normally provided in the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, they should be read in conjunction with the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes, and the shaded sections of the 2021 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). Certain disclosures are included in the shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the MD&A in this report, as permitted by IFRS, and form an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 2: CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES There were no new accounting policies that have been adopted by the Bank for the three months ended January 31, 2022. The following standard has been issued, but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of applying the standard on the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and will adopt the standard when it becomes effective. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023 for the Bank. OSFI’s related Advisory precludes early adoption. The standard will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. The Bank is proceeding with the implementation efforts accordingly.

Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The expected credit loss (ECL) model requires the application of estimates and judgment in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. As a result of COVID-19, there is a higher degree of uncertainty in determining reasonable and supportable forward-looking information. Management exercises expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date, by considering reasonable and supportable information that is not already included in the quantitative models. The current environment is subject to rapid change and to the extent that certain effects of COVID-19 are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, increased temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. This includes borrower credit scores, industry and geography specific COVID-19 impacts, payment support initiatives introduced by the Bank and governments, and the persistence of the economic shutdown, the effects of which are not yet fully reflected in the quantitative models. The Bank has performed certain additional qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s approach and methodologies used to determine fair value measurements for the three months ended January 31, 2022. (a) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE The following table reflects the fair value of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value.

        "summary": "The text discusses the significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions used by the Bank, emphasizing their importance in understanding the Bank's financial results and condition. It highlights the complexity and subjectivity involved in these judgments, particularly under uncertain conditions like those caused by COVID-19. The Bank uses the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model, which requires careful judgment in assessing credit risk and determining ECLs, especially given the uncertainty of the economic environment due to the pandemic. The Bank has made additional qualitative assessments to account for these uncertainties. Additionally, the text notes that there have been no significant changes in the Bank's methodologies for fair value measurements as of January 31, 2022. It provides a table showing the fair value of financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, indicating slight differences between carrying and fair values for various financial instruments."

        "summary": "The financial text provides a detailed analysis of the credit quality and risk management of TD Bank's debt securities and loans as of January 31, 2022, compared to October 31, 2021. The bank uses a borrower risk rating (BRR) system to evaluate non-retail credit risk, including debt securities, which are categorized into investment grade, non-investment grade, and other risk levels. The total debt securities, net of allowance, increased from $341.8 billion to $365.1 billion. The allowance for credit losses on debt securities remained minimal, indicating stable credit quality.\n\nFor loans and acceptances, the total amount net of allowance increased from $742.7 billion to $762.6 billion. The bank manages retail exposures using predictive credit scoring and non-retail exposures with a 21-point BRR scale. The allowance for loan losses decreased slightly, reflecting improved credit conditions. The text also details off-balance sheet credit instruments and the allowance for credit losses, which decreased from $8.9 billion to $7.1 billion, indicating a reduction in expected credit losses. Overall, the bank's credit risk management shows stability and slight improvement in credit quality."

        "summary": "The text provides a detailed breakdown of TD Bank's allowance for loan losses by stage for the three months ended January 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The data is segmented into different loan categories: Residential Mortgages, Consumer Instalment and Other Personal, Credit Card, and Business and Government. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Overall Allowance Reduction**: The total allowance for loan losses decreased from $7,933 million in 2021 to $6,239 million in 2022, indicating an improvement in credit conditions or risk assessment.\n\n2. **Stage Transfers**: There were significant movements between stages, reflecting changes in credit risk. For instance, transfers to Stage 2 and Stage 3 were notable across all categories, indicating shifts in credit risk perception.\n\n3. **New Originations and Repayments**: New loan originations and repayments affected the allowance, with new originations increasing the allowance and repayments decreasing it.\n\n4. **Risk and Model Changes**: Adjustments due to changes in risk parameters and models had a substantial impact on the allowance, particularly in the Consumer Instalment and Other Personal, and Credit Card categories.\n\n5. **Write-offs and Recoveries**: Write-offs were significant, especially in the Credit Card category, but there were also recoveries that partially offset these losses.\n\n6. **Foreign Exchange and Adjustments**: Foreign exchange and other adjustments had varying impacts across different loan categories.\n\nOverall, the data reflects TD Bank's ongoing management of credit risk and adjustments to its loan loss provisions in response to changing economic conditions and credit risk assessments."

        "chunk": "(e) FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Relevant macroeconomic factors are incorporated in risk parameters as appropriate. Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. The key macroeconomic variables used in determining ECLs include regional unemployment rates for all retail exposures and regional housing price indices for residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. For business and government loans, the key macroeconomic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, and credit spreads. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of how forward-looking information is generated and considered in determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and in measuring ECLs. Macroeconomic Variables Select macroeconomic variables are projected over the forecast period. The following table represents the average values of the macroeconomic variables over the four calendar quarters starting with the current quarter, and the remaining 4-year forecast period for the base forecast and upside and downside scenarios used in determining the Bank’s ECLs as at January 31, 2022. As the forecast period increases, information about the future becomes less readily available and projections are anchored on assumptions around structural relationships between economic parameters that are inherently much less certain. Relative to a year ago, the economy has made substantial progress in recovering from the economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As the economy moves farther away from the initial economic shocks of the pandemic, uncertainty around the economic forecast continues to decrease.

(f) SENSITIVITY OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ECLs are sensitive to the inputs used in internally developed models, the macroeconomic variables in the forward-looking forecasts and respective probability weightings in determining the probability-weighted ECLs, and other factors considered when applying expert credit judgment. Changes in these inputs, assumptions, models, and judgments would affect the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of ECLs. The following table presents the base ECL scenario compared to the probability-weighted ECLs, with the latter derived from three ECL scenarios for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The difference reflects the impact of deriving multiple scenarios around the base ECLs and resultant change in ECLs due to non-linearity and sensitivity to using macroeconomic forecasts. Change from Base to Probability-Weighted ECLs (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) As at January 31, 2022 October 31, 2021 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 6,455 $ 6,608 Base ECLs 6,306 6,412 Difference – in amount $ 149 $ 196 Difference – in percentage 2.4 % 3.1 % ECLs for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments consist of an aggregate amount of Stage 1 and Stage 2 probability-weighted ECLs which are twelve- month ECLs and lifetime ECLs, respectively. Transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2 ECLs result from a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the loan. The following table shows the estimated impact of staging on ECLs by presenting all performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments calculated using twelve-month ECLs compared to the current aggregate probability-weighted ECLs, holding all risk profiles constant. Incremental Lifetime ECLs Impact (millions of Canadian dollars) As at January 31, 2022 October 31, 2021 Probability-weighted ECLs $ 6,455 $ 6,608 All performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments using 12-month ECLs 4,802 4,903 Incremental lifetime ECLs impact $ 1,653 $ 1,705 TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 63",
        "summary": "The text discusses the incorporation of forward-looking macroeconomic factors into the calculation of Expected Credit Losses (ECLs) for a bank. Key macroeconomic variables include unemployment rates, GDP, interest rates, and housing prices, which are used to assess credit risk for different types of loans. The text highlights the use of base, upside, and downside scenarios to project these variables over a forecast period, noting that uncertainty decreases as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. The sensitivity of ECLs to changes in these inputs and assumptions is also discussed, with a comparison of base ECLs to probability-weighted ECLs, showing a slight increase in ECLs due to non-linearity and sensitivity to macroeconomic forecasts. The text also details the impact of staging on ECLs, with a focus on the transition from 12-month to lifetime ECLs for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments."

The Bank does not generally occupy foreclosed properties for its business use. The Bank predominantly relies on third-party appraisals to determine the carrying value of foreclosed assets. Foreclosed assets held for sale were $35 million as at January 31, 2022 (October 31, 2021 – $53 million), and were recorded in Other assets on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet. (h) LOANS PAST DUE BUT NOT IMPAIRED A loan is classified as past due when a borrower has failed to make a payment by the contractual due date. The following table summarizes loans that are past due but not impaired. Loans less than 31 days contractually past due are excluded as they do not generally reflect a borrower’s ability to meet their payment obligations.

(i) TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS QUALIFYING FOR DERECOGNITION Canada Emergency Business Account Program Under the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) Program, with funding provided by Her Majesty in Right of Canada (the “Government of Canada”) and Export Development Canada as the Government of Canada’s agent, the Bank provided eligible business banking customers with an interest-free, partially forgivable loan of up to $60,000. On January 12, 2022, it was announced that the repayment deadline for CEBA loans to qualify for partial loan forgiveness is being extended from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 for all eligible borrowers in good standing. If the loan is not repaid by December 31, 2023, it will be extended for an additional 2-year term bearing an interest rate of 5% per annum. The application window for new CEBA loans and expansion requests closed on June 30, 2021. The funding provided to the Bank by the Government of Canada in respect of the CEBA Program represents an obligation to pass-through collections on the CEBA loans and is otherwise non-recourse to the Bank. Accordingly, the Bank is required to remit all collections of principal and interest on the CEBA loans to the Government of Canada but is not required to repay amounts that its customers fail to pay or that have been forgiven. The Bank receives an administration fee to recover the costs to administer the program for the Government of Canada. Loans issued under the program are not recognized on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as the Bank transfers substantially all risks and rewards in respect of the loans to the Government of Canada. NOTE 7: INVESTMENT IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES The Bank has significant influence over The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) and the ability to participate in the financial and operating policy-making decisions of Schwab through a combination of the Bank’s ownership, board representation and the insured deposit account agreement between the Bank and Schwab (the “Schwab IDA Agreement”). As such, the Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The Bank’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. The Bank takes into account changes in the subsequent period that would significantly affect the results. As at January 31, 2022, the Bank’s reported investment in Schwab was 13.39% (October 31, 2021 – 13.41%) of the outstanding voting and non-voting common shares of Schwab with a fair value of $28 billion (US$22 billion) (October 31, 2021 – $26 billion (US$21 billion)) based on the closing price of US$87.70 (October 31, 2021 – US$82.03) on the New York Stock Exchange. The Bank and Schwab are party to a stockholder agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”) under which the Bank has the right to designate two members of Schwab’s Board of Directors and has representation on two Board Committees, subject to the Bank meeting certain conditions. The Bank’s designated directors currently are the Bank’s Group President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank’s Chair of the Board. Under the Stockholder Agreement, the Bank is not permitted to own more than 9.9% voting common shares of Schwab, and the Bank is subject to customary standstill restrictions and, subject to certain exceptions, transfer restrictions. In addition, the Schwab IDA Agreement has an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2022 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 64",

All other assumptions are updated annually. 3 Amounts are presented on a pre-tax basis. NOTE 15: INCOME TAXES The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), Revenu Québec Agency (RQA) and Alberta Tax and Revenue Administration (ATRA) are denying certain dividend deductions claimed by the Bank. During the quarter, the CRA reassessed the Bank for $154 million of additional income tax and interest in respect of its 2016 taxation year. As at January 31, 2022, the CRA has reassessed the Bank for $1,186 million of income tax and interest for the years 2011 to 2016, the RQA has reassessed the Bank for $34 million for the years 2011 to 2015, and the ATRA has reassessed the Bank for $33 million for the years 2011 to 2014. In February 2022, the ATRA reassessed the Bank for $21 million of additional income tax and interest in respect of its 2015 and 2016 taxation years. In total, the Bank has been reassessed for $1,274 million of income tax and interest. The Bank expects the CRA, RQA, and ATRA to continue to reassess open years on the same basis. The Bank is of the view that its tax filing positions were appropriate and intends to challenge all reassessments. NOTE 16: EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the same method as basic earnings per share except that certain adjustments are made to net income attributable to common shareholders and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares that are assumed to be issued by the Bank. The following table presents the Bank’s basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2021. Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share (millions of Canadian dollars, except as noted) For the three months ended January 31 2022 January 31 2021 Basic earnings per share Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,690 $ 3,212 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (millions) 1,820.5 1,814.2 Basic earnings per share (Canadian dollars) $ 2.03 $ 1.77 Diluted earnings per share Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,690 $ 3,212 Net income available to common shareholders including impact of dilutive securities 3,690 3,212 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (millions) 1,820.5 1,814.2 Effect of dilutive securities Stock options potentially exercisable (millions)1 3.6 1.6 Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding – diluted (millions) 1,824.1 1,815.8 Diluted earnings per share (Canadian dollars)1 $ 2.02 $ 1.77 1 For the three months ended January 31, 2022, no outstanding options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. For the three months ended January 31, 2021, the computation of diluted earnings per share excluded average options outstanding of 4.9 million, with a weighted-average exercise price $72.55, as the option price was greater than the average market price of the Bank’s common shares.

        "summary": "The financial text provides insights into several key areas for the Bank:\n\n1. **Remeasurements in Other Comprehensive Income**: For the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Bank recognized remeasurement gains of $362 million for principal pension plans and $15 million for principal post-retirement benefit plans. This is a decrease from the previous year, where gains were $549 million and $4 million, respectively.\n\n2. **Tax Reassessments**: The Bank is facing reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), Revenu Québec Agency (RQA), and Alberta Tax and Revenue Administration (ATRA) totaling $1,274 million for income tax and interest for various years between 2011 and 2016. The Bank plans to challenge these reassessments, maintaining that its tax positions were appropriate.\n\n3. **Earnings Per Share**: For the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Bank reported a basic earnings per share of $2.03, up from $1.77 in the same period in 2021. The diluted earnings per share was $2.02, also up from $1.77 in 2021. The increase in earnings per share reflects higher net income attributable to common shareholders.\n\nOverall, the Bank experienced a decrease in remeasurement gains, is contesting significant tax reassessments, and reported an increase in earnings per share compared to the previous year."

        "chunk": "NOTE 17: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Other than as described below, there have been no new significant events or transactions as previously identified in Note 27 of the Bank’s 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, including but not limited to civil claims and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits and requests for information by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions. The Bank establishes provisions when it becomes probable that the Bank will incur a loss and the amount can be reliably estimated. The Bank also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) in its legal and regulatory actions (that is, those which are neither probable nor remote), in excess of provisions. As at January 31, 2022, the Bank’s RPL is from zero to approximately $1.39 billion (October 31, 2021 – from zero to approximately $1.45 billion). The Bank’s provisions and RPL represent the Bank’s best estimates based upon currently available information for actions for which estimates can be made, but there are a number of factors that could cause the Bank’s provisions and/or RPL to be significantly different from its actual or RPL. For example, the Bank’s estimates involve significant judgment due to the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants in many proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, some of which are beyond the Bank’s control and/or involve novel legal theories and interpretations, the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. In addition, some actions seek very large or indeterminate damages. In management’s opinion, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the ultimate disposition of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or the consolidated cash flows of the Bank. However, because of the factors listed above, as well as other uncertainties inherent in litigation and regulatory matters, there is a possibility that the ultimate resolution of legal or regulatory actions may be material to the Bank’s consolidated results of operations for any particular reporting period. Stanford Litigation – On January 20, 2022, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Bank’s motion for summary judgment in Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. Also on January 20, 2022, the Court issued a Suggestion of Remand that recommended to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) that the Rotstain matter be remanded for further proceedings to the Southern District of Texas. That day, the JPML issued a Conditional Remand Order, which took effect on January 27, 2022. A joint status report was filed in the Smith v. Independent Bank et al. action on January 31, 2022. In the report, the removing bank defendant requested a status conference to address how to resolve the overlapping issues with the Rotstain litigation. Plaintiffs’ position is that the Smith matter should continue to be stayed. In Ontario, the hearing of the appeal in the Joint Liquidators’ action is scheduled for April 20-21, 2022. Credit Card Fees – On December 10, 2021, after a joint settlement approval hearing on December 6, 2021, the national settlement was approved by the five courts in which the actions were filed. TD Ameritrade Stockholder Litigation – On January 20, 2022, the parties (i.e., plaintiff and all defendants) informed the Court that they had reached an agreement in principle to resolve the action subject to the parties’ ability to satisfy certain conditions and their submission of a stipulation memorializing the settlement.

        "summary": "The text discusses the contingent liabilities of a bank, highlighting ongoing legal and regulatory actions involving the bank and its subsidiaries. The bank establishes provisions for probable losses and estimates a range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) that are not probable but not remote, with the RPL as of January 31, 2022, ranging from zero to approximately $1.39 billion. The bank acknowledges that these estimates involve significant judgment and could differ from actual outcomes due to various uncertainties. Despite these uncertainties, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these actions will not materially affect the bank's consolidated financial condition or cash flows, though they could impact results for specific reporting periods. Specific cases mentioned include the Stanford Litigation, which has been partially remanded for further proceedings, and the TD Ameritrade Stockholder Litigation, where a settlement agreement in principle has been reached. Additionally, a national settlement regarding credit card fees was approved in December 2021."

        "chunk": "NOTE 20: REGULATORY CAPITAL The Bank manages its capital under guidelines established by OSFI. The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relation to credit, market, and operational risks. The Bank has various capital policies, procedures, and controls which it utilizes to achieve its goals and objectives. On November 22, 2019, the Bank was designated a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). During the three months ended January 31, 2022, the Bank complied with the OSFI Basel III guidelines related to capital ratios and the leverage ratios. Effective January 1, 2016, OSFI’s target Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios for Canadian banks designated as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) includes a 1% common equity capital surcharge bringing the targets to 8%, 9.5%, and 11.5%, respectively. On June 25, 2018, OSFI provided greater transparency related to previously undisclosed Pillar 2 CET1 capital buffers through the introduction of the public domestic stability buffer (DSB) which is held by D-SIBs against Pillar 2 risks. The current buffer is set at 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets (RWA) and must be met with CET1 Capital, effectively raising the OSFI CET1 minimum target to 10.5%. The OSFI target includes the greater of the D-SIB or G-SIB surcharge, both of which are currently 1%. On September 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). Under this guideline, the Bank was required to meet supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.0% of RWA, inclusive of the 2.50% DSB, and TLAC leverage ratio target of 6.75% by November 1, 2021. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio. The following table summarizes the Bank’s regulatory capital positions as at January 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021.

The shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the MD&A relating to market, liquidity, and insurance risks are an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 22: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Acquisition of First Horizon Corporation On February 28, 2022, the Bank and First Horizon Corporation (“First Horizon”) announced a definitive agreement for the Bank to acquire First Horizon in an all- cash transaction valued at US$13.4 billion, or US$25.00 for each common share of First Horizon. In connection with this transaction, the Bank has invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock (convertible in certain circumstances into up to 4.9% of First Horizon’s common stock). The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals from First Horizon’s shareholders and U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities. The results of the acquired business will be consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and reported in the U.S. Retail segment. If the transaction does not close prior to November 27, 2022, First Horizon shareholders will receive, at closing, an additional US$0.65 per share on an annualized basis for the period from November 27, 2022 through the day immediately prior to the closing. Either party will have the right to terminate the agreement if the transaction has not closed by February 27, 2023 (the “outside date”), subject to the right of either party (under certain conditions) to extend the outside date to May 27, 2023. Concurrent with the announcement, the automatic share purchase plan established under the Bank’s NCIB automatically terminated pursuant to its terms. The NCIB remains in effect on the same terms and subject to the same restrictions as previously disclosed. Rothstein Litigation Settlement Recovery Subsequent to quarter end, the Bank reached a settlement in TD Bank, N.A. v. Lloyd’s Underwriters et al., in Canada. The Bank received $225 million as a recovery of losses incurred resulting from the previous resolution by TD in the U.S. of multiple proceedings related to an alleged Ponzi scheme perpetrated by, among others, Scott Rothstein.
