The U.S. Retail Bank, which excludes the Bank’s investment in Schwab, reported net income of $713 million (US$526 million), a decrease of 44% (45% in U.S. dollars) from the first quarter last year, primarily reflecting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment, lower revenue and higher PCL.

The bank also highlighted its restructuring initiatives and new product launches, such as the Low Rate Visa card and innovations for small business clients."

In connection with these measures, the Bank incurred $291 million of restructuring charges which primarily relate to employee severance and other personnel-related costs and real estate optimization. The Bank continues to expect to incur restructuring charges in the first half of calendar 2024 that are of a similar magnitude to the restructuring charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. b) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment On November 16, 2023, the FDIC announced a final rule that implements a special assessment to recover the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors during the U.S. bank failures in the spring of 2023. The FDIC special assessment resulted in the recognition of $411 million (US$300 million) pre-tax in non-interest expenses in the first quarter of the Bank’s fiscal 2024. On February 23, 2024, the FDIC notified all institutions subject to the special assessment that its estimate of total losses has increased compared to the amount communicated with the final rule in November 2023. The FDIC plans to provide institutions subject to the special assessment an updated estimate with its first quarter 2024 special assessment invoice, to be released in June 2024. At this time, it is not known what the final FDIC special assessment will be, but the Bank expects the FDIC special assessment to increase. The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”). TD is the sixth largest bank in North America by assets and serves more than 27.5 million customers in four key businesses operating in a number of locations in financial centres around the globe: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, including TD Canada Trust and TD Auto Finance Canada; U.S. Retail, including TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank®, TD Auto Finance U.S., TD Wealth (U.S.), and an investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation; Wealth Management and Insurance, including TD Wealth (Canada), TD Direct Investing, and TD Insurance; and Wholesale Banking, including TD Securities and TD Cowen. TD also ranks among the world’s leading online financial services firms, with more than 17 million active online and mobile customers. TD had $1.91 trillion in assets on January 31, 2024. The Toronto Dominion Bank trades under the symbol “TD” on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges. The Bank prepares its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS and refers to results prepared in accordance with IFRS as “reported” results. Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures In addition to reported results, the Bank also presents certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures that are historical, non-GAAP ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures, to assess its results. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as “adjusted” results, are utilized to assess the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note” from reported results. Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP ratios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, net of ISE, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the Bank’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. Supplementary financial measures depict the Bank’s financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the Bank’s capital position, and both are explained in this document where they first appear. U.S. Strategic Cards The Bank’s U.S. strategic cards portfolio is comprised of agreements with certain U.S. retailers pursuant to which TD is the U.S. issuer of private label and co branded consumer credit cards to their U.S. customers. Under the terms of the individual agreements, the Bank and the retailers share in the profits generate the relevant portfolios after credit losses. Under IFRS, TD is required to present the gross amount of revenue and PCL related to these portfolios in the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Statement of Income. At the segment level, the retailer program partners’ share of revenues and credit losses is presented in the Corpor segment, with an offsetting amount (representing the partners’ net share) recorded in Non-interest expenses, resulting in no impact to Corporate’s reported n income (loss). The net income (loss) included in the U.S. Retail segment includes only the portion of revenue and credit losses attributable to TD under the agreements. Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation and IDA Agreement On October 6, 2020, the Bank acquired an approximately 13.5% stake in The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) following the completion of Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (“TD Ameritrade”) of which the Bank was a major shareholder (the “Schwab transaction”). On August 1, 2022, the Bank sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Schwab, at a price of US$66.53 per share for proceeds of $2.5 billion (US$1.9 billion), which reduced the Bank’s ownership interest in Schwab to approximately 12.0%. The Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The U.S. Retail segment reflects the Bank’s share of net income from its investment in Schwab. The Corporate segment net income (loss) includes amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles, the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction, and the Bank’s share of restructuring and other charges incurred by Schwab. The Bank’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. For further details, refer to Note 7 of the Bank’s first quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. On November 25, 2019, the Bank and Schwab signed an insured deposit account agreement (the “2019 Schwab IDA Agreement”), with an initial expiration date of July 1, 2031. Under the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first quarter 2024 report highlights several key financial activities and strategic measures. The bank incurred $291 million in restructuring charges aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency, primarily related to employee severance and real estate optimization. Additionally, TD recognized a $411 million pre-tax expense due to a special assessment by the FDIC, which aims to recover losses from U.S. bank failures in 2023. The bank anticipates further increases in this assessment. TD Bank, the sixth largest in North America by assets, continues to utilize non-GAAP financial measures to provide a clearer view of its performance. The bank's U.S. strategic cards portfolio involves partnerships with U.S. retailers, sharing profits after credit losses. TD also maintains a significant investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation, reflecting its share of net income in the U.S. Retail segment. The bank's financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, with adjustments for non-GAAP measures to better assess performance."

Pursuant to the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank continues to make sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Sch wab designates a portion of the deposits with the Bank as fixed-rate obligation amounts (FROA). Remaining deposits over the minimum level of FROA are desi gnated as floating-rate obligations. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by thre e years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, fo llowed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until Septe mber 2025, the aggregate FROA will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to $6.8 billion (US$5 billion) of FROA by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to certain limits. Refer to the “Rel ated Party Transactions” section in the 2023 MD&A for further details. During the first quarter of 2024, Schwab exercised its option to buy down the remaining $0.7 billion (US$0.5 billion) of the US$5 billion FROA buydown allowance and paid $32 m illion (US$23 million) in termination fees to the Bank in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's First Quarter 2024 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Net Income**: Reported net income for Q1 2024 was $2,824 million, a 79% increase from Q1 2023, primarily due to the absence of last year's Stanford litigation settlement and the terminated FHN acquisition-related capital hedging strategy. Adjusted net income decreased by 12% to $3,637 million, mainly due to higher non-interest expenses and provisions for credit losses (PCL).\n\n2. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: Adjusted diluted EPS decreased by 10% compared to the same period last year. Reported basic and diluted EPS were $1.55, with adjustments for items of note bringing adjusted EPS to $2.00.\n\n3. **Return on Equity (ROE)**: The reported ROE was 10.9%, while the adjusted ROE was 14.1%. The adjusted return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 18.7%.\n\n4. **Net Interest Income**: There was a 3% decrease in reported net interest income to $7,488 million, attributed to lower income in Wholesale Banking and U.S. Retail. Adjusted net interest income also decreased by 4%.\n\n5. **Non-Interest Income**: Reported non-interest income increased by 39% to $6,226 million, driven by higher equity commissions, lending revenue, and trading-related revenue. Adjusted non-interest income rose by 19%.\n\n6. **Provision for Credit Losses (PCL)**: PCL increased to $1,001 million, reflecting normalization in consumer lending and credit migration in commercial lending. The increase was primarily in U.S. Retail and Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking.\n\n7. **Segment Performance**: The Corporate segment saw a significant increase in reported net income, while U.S. Retail and Wholesale Banking experienced declines.\n\n8. **Foreign Exchange Impact**: The impact of foreign exchange rates on U.S. Retail segment earnings was minimal.\n\nOverall, the report indicates a challenging quarter with increased expenses and credit provisions impacting adjusted earnings, despite a strong increase in reported net income due to the absence of significant one-time charges from the previous year."

Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Bank operates. The earliest the legislation w ill be effective for the Bank is the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2024.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first quarter 2024 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Insurance Service Expenses**: These increased by 17% year-over-year to $1,366 million, primarily due to higher claims severity and less favorable prior years' claims development. Compared to the previous quarter, expenses rose by 1%, influenced by similar factors but partially offset by fewer severe weather events.\n\n2. **Non-Interest Expenses and Efficiency Ratio**: Reported non-interest expenses decreased by 1% year-over-year to $8,030 million, mainly due to the prior year's Stanford litigation settlement. However, on an adjusted basis, expenses increased by 12% to $7,125 million. The reported efficiency ratio improved to 58.6% from 66.5% last year, while the adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.4%, up from 53.2%.\n\n3. **Income Taxes**: The effective income tax rate decreased to 19.1% from 42.0% year-over-year, largely due to prior period tax adjustments and changes in earnings mix. The adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4%, down from 21.7% last year.\n\n4. **Canadian and International Tax Measures**: New Canadian tax measures, including a 2% tax on share repurchases, are proposed to take effect in 2024. Internationally, the OECD's Pillar Two global minimum tax rules are being assessed by the Bank, with potential impacts expected from November 2024.\n\nOverall, the report indicates increased insurance expenses, a decrease in reported non-interest expenses due to prior settlements, and significant tax rate changes influenced by legislative adjustments and earnings mix."

Inflation has generally continued to cool ac ross the G-7, and central banks are expected to start lowering interest rates soon. However, the pace of decline is expected to be gradual with central bankers v igilant on inflation risks. The lagged impact of cumulative interest rate hikes is expected to be the primary influence dampening economic growth and returning inf lation closer to the target ranges of the various regions by the end of calendar 2024. Geopolitical events remain a downside risk to the economic forecast. The U.S. economy grew at a solid 3.3% annualized pace in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. Consumer spending remained healthy, growing at a solid 2.8% pac e, while business investment was more modest, rising 1.9%. Government spending continued to provide support to growth, while housing activity expanded for the second consecutive quarter. Overall, the U.S. economy accelerated from a 1.9% pace in calendar 2022 to 2.5% in 2023. Bas ed on the January 2024 data, the U.S. job market was still tight with the unemployment rate historically low at 3.7%. The labour market has shown impressive resilience in recent months, with job openings still elevated relative to their pre-pandemic level and the pace of hiring picking up slightly in recent m onths. Although the downturn in total inflation has stalled due to higher energy costs, core inflation measures have continued to move lower. This has prompted t he central bank to entertain discussions on when interest rate cuts will become appropriate. D Economics expects the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates mid-year from their current restrictive level of 5.25-5.50% to 4.25%-4.50% by t he end of calendar 2024. Interest rates are still expected to weigh on demand through the year. The Canadian economy slowed notably in calendar 2023. Real GDP contracted in the third calendar quarter by 1% annualized, however domestic demand still gre w by a modest 1.3%. TD Economics expects economic activity to have returned to growth in the final calendar quarter of 2023, thereby avoiding a technical rec ession. The trend rate of job growth has also slowed below that of the labour force, pushing the unemployment rate higher. TD Economics expects the une mployment rate to continue to move higher in the months ahead, contributing to prolonged weakness in consumer spending. As a result, economic growth is likely to remain quite modest through calendar 2024. Against that subdued backdrop, the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the substantial interest rate hikes s till working their way through the economy leaves recession risks elevated in Canada. espite signs of slowing in the Canadian economy, progress on inflation has stalled in recent months. The Bank of Canada has left the overnight interest rate unc hanged at 5.00% since July, but continues to express concern about the persistence of underlying inflation. TD Economics expects some cooling in inflationary dynamics will allow the Bank of Canada to lower interest rates in the spring, albeit at a gradual pace. The Canadian dollar is expected to hover in the 73 to 74 U.S. c ent range over the next few quarters. or management reporting purposes, the Bank’s business operations and activities are organized around the following four key business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The Bank’s other activities are grouped into the orporate segment. Results of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the Bank m easures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments, the Bank indicates that the measure is adju sted. For further details, refer to the “How We Performed” section of this document, the “Business Focus” section in the Bank’s 20 23 MD&A, and Note 28 of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2023. Effective the first quarter of 2024, certain asset management businesses w hich were previously reported in the U.S. Retail segment are now reported in the Wealth Management and Insurance segment. Comparative period information has been adjusted to reflect the new alignment. CL related to performing (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and impaired (Stage 3) financial assets, loan commitments, and financial guarantees is recorded within the res pective segment. Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt income, including certain dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent pre-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans c onsistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking results is reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the quarter was $29 million, compared with $44 million in the prior quarter and $57 million in the first quarter last year. Share of net income from investment in Schwab is reported in the U.S. Retail segment. Amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles, the acquisition and int egration charges related to the Schwab transaction, and the Bank’s share of restructuring and other charges incurred by Schwab are recorded in the Corporate s egment.

Inflation is cooling across the G-7, and central banks are likely to begin lowering interest rates gradually, with vigilance on inflation risks.\n\n2. **U.S. Economic Performance**: The U.S. economy grew at a 3.3% annualized rate in Q4 2023, with strong consumer spending and modest business investment. The labor market remains tight, with a low unemployment rate of 3.7%. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates mid-year from 5.25-5.50% to 4.25%-4.50% by the end of 2024.\n\n3. **Canadian Economic Conditions**: The Canadian economy slowed in 2023, with a contraction in Q3 but a return to growth in Q4, avoiding a technical recession. The unemployment rate is rising, and consumer spending is weak. The Bank of Canada has kept interest rates unchanged at 5.00% but may lower them in the spring as inflationary pressures ease.\n\n4. **TD Bank's Financial Performance**: The bank's business operations are organized into four segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. Adjustments have been made to segment reporting, particularly in asset management. The Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segment reported increased net interest income and total revenue compared to previous quarters.\n\n5. **Financial Metrics**: The bank's return on common equity was 34.6%, with a net interest margin of 2.84%. The efficiency ratio improved slightly, and the number of Canadian retail branches and staff remained stable.\n\nOverall, the report indicates cautious optimism about economic conditions, with potential interest rate cuts on the horizon, while TD Bank continues to perform steadily across its business segments."

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's U.S. Retail segment reported a decline in net income for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest income and total revenue both decreased year-over-year, while provisions for credit losses increased, indicating higher credit risk. Non-interest expenses rose significantly, partly due to a special FDIC assessment. The reported return on common equity and net interest margin both declined, reflecting reduced profitability and efficiency. The bank's share of income from its investment in Schwab also decreased. Adjusted figures show a similar trend, with adjusted net income and return on equity also down from the previous year. The number of retail stores and staff remained relatively stable."

The higher net loss reflects lower revenue in treasury and balance sheet management activities and higher risk and control expenses, partially offset by lower restructuring charges. et corporate expenses increased $27 million compared to the prior quarter, mainly reflecting investments in our risk and control infrastructure. The adjusted net loss for the quarter was $218 million, compared with an adjusted net loss of $133 million in the prior quarter.

The impact of foreign exchange translation from the appre ciation in the Canadian dollar decreased total assets by $31 billion. he decrease in total assets reflects a decrease in derivative assets of $27 billion, cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $24 billion, debt securities at am ortized cost (DSAC), net of allowance for credit losses of $8 billion, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements of $5 billion, and other assets of $4 billion. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in trading loans, securities, and other of $10 billion, loans, net of allowances for loan losses of $8 billion, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) of $5 billion and investment in Schwab of $1 billion. ash and interest-bearing deposits with banks de creased $24 billion primarily reflecting cash management activities.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first quarter 2024 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Wealth Management and Insurance**: Net income was $555 million, nearly flat compared to the same quarter last year, with a slight increase of $1 million. Revenue increased by 8% to $3,135 million, driven by higher insurance premiums and fee-based revenue. However, this was offset by a 17% rise in insurance service expenses due to increased claims severity. Assets under administration and management grew by 6% each, reflecting market appreciation.\n\n2. **Wholesale Banking**: Reported net income decreased by 38% to $205 million compared to Q1 2023, primarily due to higher non-interest expenses, including costs related to the acquisition of Cowen Inc. Revenue increased by 32% to $1,780 million, driven by higher equity commissions and trading-related revenue. Adjusted net income was $298 million, down 14% from the previous year.\n\n3. **Corporate Segment**: Reported a net loss of $628 million, significantly reduced from a $2,617 million loss in Q1 2023, mainly due to the absence of the prior year's Stanford litigation settlement. Adjusted net loss was $218 million, compared to $140 million in the previous year, reflecting increased investments in risk and control infrastructure.\n\n4. **Overall Financial Performance**: Total assets decreased by $44 billion to $1,911 billion as of January 31, 2024, primarily due to foreign exchange impacts and decreases in derivative assets and cash deposits. Total liabilities also decreased by $45 billion, with significant reductions in derivative liabilities and deposits.\n\n5. **Quarterly Comparisons**: Compared to the previous quarter, Wealth Management and Insurance saw a 13% increase in net income, while Wholesale Banking's net income increased by $188 million. The Corporate segment's net loss increased by $37 million from the prior quarter.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group's first quarter of 2024 showed growth in revenue and assets under management, but faced challenges with increased expenses and foreign exchange impacts."

Financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss decreased $12 billion reflecting maturities and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by new issuances. Deposits decreased $17 billion primarily reflecting the impact of foreign exchange translation and volume decrease in bank deposits, partially offset by higher volumes in personal deposits. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $7 billion reflecting an increase in volume, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Other liabilities decreased $5 billion primarily reflecting volume decrease in acceptances and accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other items, and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by increase in amounts payable to brokers, dealers, and clients due to higher volumes of pending trades and volume increase in securitization liabilities at fair value. Equity was $112 billion as at January 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, reflecting an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, offset by lower retained earnings. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income is primarily driven by gains on cash flow hedges and the Bank’s share of the other comprehensive income from investment in Schwab, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. The retained earnings decreased primarily from dividends paid and the premium on the repurchase of common shares, partially offset by the net income for the quarter. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2023 Gross impaired loans excluding acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans were $3,709 million as at January 31, 2024, an increase of $1,118 million, or 43%, compared with the first quarter last year. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking gross impaired loans increased $552 million, or 52%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting formations outpacing resolutions in the commercial and consumer lending portfolios. U.S. Retail gross impaired loans increased $565 million, or 38%, compared with the first quarter last year, reflecting formations outpacing resolutions in the commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and the impact of foreign exchange. Wholesale gross impaired loans decreased $1 million, compared with the first quarter last year. Net impaired loans were $2,526 million as at January 31, 2024, an increase of $762 million, or 43%, compared with the first quarter last year. The allowance for credit losses of $8,268 million as at January 31, 2024 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $1,187 million, Stage 2 allowance of $4,258 million and Stage 1 allowance of $2,820 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $3 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $355 million, or 43%, reflecting further normalization of credit performance in the consumer lending portfolios, credit migration in the commercial lending portfolios, and the impact of foreign exchange. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses increased $433 million, or 7%, reflecting credit conditions, including credit migration, volume growth, and the impact of foreign exchange. The allowance change included an increase of $99 million attributable to the retailer program partners’ share of the U.S. strategic cards portfolio. The allowance for debt securities increased by $1 million, compared with the first quarter last year. Forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables deemed to be predictive of expected credit losses (ECLs) based on the Bank’s experience, is used to determine ECL scenarios and associated probability weights to determine the probability-weighted ECLs. Each quarter, all base forecast macroeconomic variables are refreshed, resulting in new upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios. The probability weightings assigned to each ECL scenario are also reviewed each quarter and updated as required, as part of the Bank’s ECL governance process. As a result of periodic reviews and quarterly updates, the allowance for credit losses may be revised to reflect updates in loss estimates based on the Bank’s recent loss experience and its forward-looking views. The Bank periodically reviews the methodology and has performed certain additional quantitative and qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant increase in credit risk. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s first quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on forward-looking information. The probability-weighted allowance for credit losses reflects the Bank’s forward-looking views. To the extent that certain anticipated effects cannot be fully incorporated into quantitative models, management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in determining the amount of ECLs. The allowance for credit losses will be updated in future quarters as additional information becomes available. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s first quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Bank calculates allowances for ECLs on debt securities measured at amortized cost and FVOCI. The Bank has $371 billion in such debt securities, all of which are performing (Stage 1 and 2) and none are impaired (Stage 3). The allowance for credit losses on DSAC and debt securities at FVOCI was $2 million and $1 million, respectively. Quarterly comparison – Q1 2024 vs. Q4 2023 Gross impaired loans excluding ACI loans increased $410 million, or 12%, compared with the prior quarter. Impaired loans net of allowance increased $249 million, or 11%, compared with the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses of $8,268 million as at January 31, 2024 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $1,187 million, Stage 2 allowance of $4,258 million and Stage 1 allowance of $2,820 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $3 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $151 million, or 15%, compared with the prior quarter, largely reflecting some further normalization of credit performance in the consumer lending portfolios, and credit migration in the commercial lending portfolios. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses decreased $71 million, compared with the prior quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by an increase in the consumer lending portfolios related to volume growth and current credit conditions, including credit migration. The allowance for debt securities decreased by $1 million, compared to the prior quarter. For further details on loans, impaired loans, allowance for credit losses, and on the Bank’s use of forward-looking information and macroeconomic variables in determining its allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 6 of the Bank’s first quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.",
        "summary": "In the first quarter of 2024, TD Bank Group reported several key financial changes. Derivative liabilities decreased by $18 billion due to changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss decreased by $12 billion, mainly due to maturities and foreign exchange impacts, despite new issuances. Deposits fell by $17 billion, influenced by foreign exchange translation and a decrease in bank deposits, though personal deposits increased. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements rose by $7 billion due to higher volumes. Other liabilities decreased by $5 billion, primarily due to lower volumes in acceptances and accounts payable, offset by increased amounts payable to brokers and dealers.\n\nEquity remained at $112 billion, with gains in accumulated other comprehensive income from cash flow hedges and investments in Schwab, offset by foreign exchange impacts and lower retained earnings due to dividends and share repurchases. Gross impaired loans increased by 43% year-over-year, with significant rises in Canadian and U.S. retail sectors, while wholesale loans saw a slight decrease. The allowance for credit losses was $8,268 million, with increases in Stage 3 allowances reflecting credit normalization and migration. Forward-looking information and macroeconomic variables are used to determine expected credit losses, with periodic reviews and updates to the allowance for credit losses.

Rea l Estate Secured Lending Retail real estate secured lending includes mortgages and lines of credit to North American consumers to satisfy financing needs including home purchases and refin ancing. While the Bank retains first lien on the majority of properties held as security, there is a small portion of loans with second liens, but most of these are behind a TD mortgage that is in first position. In Canada, credit policies are designed so that the combined exposure of all uninsured facilities on one property does not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination. Lending at a higher loan-to-v alue ratio is permitted by legislation but requires default insurance. This insu rance is contractual coverage for the life of eligible facilities and protects the Bank’s real estate secured le nding portfolio against potential losses caused by borrowers’ default. The Bank may also purchase default insurance on lower loan-to- value ratio loans. The insurance is provided by either government-backed enti ties or approved private mortgage insurers. In the U.S., for residential mortgage originations, mortgage insurance is usually obtained from either government bac ked entities or approved private mortgage insurers when the loan-to-v alue exceeds 80% of the collateral value at origination. The Bank regularly performs stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio as part of its overall stress testing program. This is done with a view to determine the ext ent to which the portfolio would be vulnerable to a severe downturn in economic conditions. The effect of severe changes in house prices, interest rates, and unem ployment levels are among the factors considered when assessing the impact on credit losses and the Bank’s overall profitability. A variety of portfolio s egments, including dwelling type and geographical regions, are examined during the exercise to determine whether specific vulnerabilities exist.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first-quarter 2024 report provides detailed insights into its real estate secured lending portfolio, focusing on residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) across Canada and the United States. As of January 31, 2024, the total real estate secured lending in Canada was $318.8 billion, with 77.8% being uninsured. Ontario holds the largest share of this portfolio. In the U.S., the total was $64.3 billion. The report highlights that 13% of the Canadian mortgage portfolio consists of loans where fixed payments are insufficient to cover interest due to rate increases. The average loan-to-value (LTV) ratios for newly originated and acquired uninsured loans are generally stable, with Canada at 65% and the U.S. at 68%. The amortization periods for Canadian mortgages show a significant portion extending beyond 25 years, reflecting the impact of variable rate increases."

Capital requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) are commonly referred to as Basel III. Under Basel III, Total Capital consists of three co mponents, namely CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III introduced a non-risk sensitive leve rage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage ex posure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit equiv alent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. TD manages its regulatory capital in accordance with OSFI’s implementation of the Basel III Capital Framework. OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III OSFI’s CAR and LR guidelines detail how the Basel III capital rules apply to Canadian banks. The Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) level was increased to 3.5% as of November 1, 2023. The 50 bps increase from the previous level of 3% reflects OSFI’s view of appropriate actions to enhance the resilience of Canada’s largest banks against vulnerabilities. The current DSB range is 0 to 4% and the DSB level may chan ge in response to developments in Canada’s financial system and the broader economic environment. On February 1, 2023, OSFI implemented revised capital rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic impl ementation. These revised rules include revisions to the calculation of credit risk and operational risk requirements, and revisions to the LR Guideline to inclu de a requirement for domestic systemically important banks (D-SI Bs) to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the regulatory minimum require ment of 3.0%. This buffer will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio. On N ovember 1, 2023, the Bank implemented OSFI’s Parental Stand-Al one (Solo) Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Framework for D-S IBs, which establishes a risk-ba sed measure intended to ensure a non-viable D-SIB has sufficient loss absorbing capacity on a stand-alon e, legal entity basis to support its reso lution. The Bank is compliant with the requirements set out in this new framework. The table below summarizes OSFI’s current regulatory minimum capital targets for the Bank as at January 31, 2024. Minimum Capital Conservation Buffer D-SIB / G-SIB Surcharge 1 Pillar 1 Regulatory Target 2 DSB Pillar 1 & 2 Regulatory Target CET1 4.5 % 2.5 % 1.0 % 8.0 % 3.5 % 11.5 % Tier 1 6.0 2.5 1.0 9.5 3.5 13.0 Total Capital 8.0 2.5 1.0 11.5 3.5 15.0 Leverage 3.0 n/a 3 0.5 3.5 n/a 3.5 TLAC 18.0 2.5 1.0 21.5 3.5 25.0 TLAC Leverage 6.75 n/a 0. 50 7.25 n/a 7. 25 1 The higher of the D-SIB and Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) surcharge applies to risk weighted capital. The D- SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the Bank’s 1% G-SIB additional com mon equity requirement for risk weighted capital. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%. OSFI’s Leverage Requirements Guideline includes a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer set at 50% of a D-SIB’s higher loss absorbency risk-weighted require ments, effectively 0.50%. This buffer also applies to the TLAC Leverage ratio. 2 The Ban k’s countercyclical buffer requirement is 0% as of January 3 1, 2024. 3 Not applicable.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's First Quarter 2024 report highlights its sovereign risk and regulatory capital management. The bank's direct credit exposures outside Canada and the U.S. are detailed, with significant exposures in Europe, the UK, Asia, and other regions, totaling CAD 114.6 billion as of January 31, 2024. The report also discusses the implementation of Basel III capital requirements by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) in Canada. Key regulatory capital ratios, including CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital, are outlined, with a Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) increased to 3.5% to enhance resilience against vulnerabilities. The bank has also implemented OSFI's Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) framework for domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), ensuring sufficient loss-absorbing capacity. The report confirms the bank's compliance with these regulatory requirements."

The indicator-ba sed measurement approach, currently in effect, divides the thirteen indicators into five categories, with each category yielding a 20% weight to a bank’ s total score on the G-S IB scale. TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 26 The following table provides the results of the thirteen indicators for the Bank. The increase in Payments activity was primarily due to US-d ollar activities. Trading volume increase was mainly driven by higher U.S. fixed income trading. The increase in Trading and other securities was due to an increase in treasury and go vernment-related securities. Other notable changes in the indicators from prior year primarily reflect normal business activities of the Bank. Glo bal Systemically Important Banks D isclosures The Financial Stability Board (FSB), in consultation with the BCBS and national authorities, identifies G-SIBs. The G-SIB assessment methodology is based on the sub missions of the largest global banks. Thirteen indicators are used in the G-SIB assessment methodology to determine systemic importance. The score for a particular indicator is calculated by dividing the individual bank value by the aggregate amount for the indicator summed across all banks included in the ass essment. Accordingly, an indi vidual bank’s ranking is reliant on the results and submissions of other global banks. The Bank is required to publish the thirteen indicators used in the G-SIB indicator-based assessment framework. Public disclosure of financial year-end data is required annually, no later than the date of a bank’s first quarter public disclosure of shareholder financial data in the follo wing year. Public communications on G-SIB status are issued annually each November. On November 22, 2019, the Bank was designated as a G-SIB by the FSB. The Bank continued to maintain its G-SIB status when the FSB published the 2023 list of G-SIBs on November 27, 2023. As a result of this designation, the Bank is subj ect to an additional loss absorbency requirement (CET1 as a percentage of RWA) of 1% under applicable FSB member authority requirements. The Bank’s G-S IB designation has no additional impact on the Bank’s minimum CET1 regulatory requirements, as the G-SIB surcharge is consistent with the D-SIB requirement set out by OSFI. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maximum of 4.5%. BLE 25: G-SIB INDICATORS 1 1 The G-SIB indicators are prepared based on the methodology prescribed in BCBS guidelines published and disclosed in accordance with OSFI’s Advisory on G -SIBs – Public Disclosure Requirements. Given the Bank was designated as a G-SIB by the FSB on November 22, 2019, additional public disclosures on these indicators are required. Refer to the Bank’s Regulatory Capit al Disclosures at www .td.com/investor-relations/ir- homepage/regulatory-disclosures/g-sib/disclosures.jsp for th ese additional disclosures on the 2023 G-SIB indicators. The Bank is required to submit its G-SIB indicators to OSFI and BCBS for review following the date of this report. In the event that one or both regulators provide comments to the Bank regarding its submission that would result in changes to the G- SIB indicators listed in the table above, the Bank will publish such revised G-SIB i ndicators on its website.

The decrease in the Bank’s CET1 Capital ratio from 14.4% as at October 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to RWA growth across various segments, common shares repurchased for cancellation, and t he impact of the regulatory changes related to the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book and Negatively amortizing mortgages. CET1 was also impacted by t he FDIC special assessment booked in the quarter. The impact of the foregoing items was partially offset by organic growth, and the issuance of common shares pursuant to the Bank’s dividend reinvestment plan. TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 28 As at January 31, 2024, the Bank’s leverage ratio was 4.4%, consistent with the ratio reported at October 31, 2023.

Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on c ommon shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average m arket price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion or purchased from the open market at market price. uring the three months ended January 31, 2024, the Bank issued 2 .0 million common shares from treasury with no discount. During the three months ended January 31, 2023, the Bank issued 7.9 million common shares from treasury with a 2% discount. On August 28, 2023, the Bank announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange and OSFI approved a normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to repurchase for cancellation up to 90 million of its common shares. The NCIB commenced on August 31, 2023, and during the three months ended January 31, 2024, the Bank repurchased 20. 9 million common shares under the NCIB, at an average price of $82.39 per share for a total amount of $1.7 billion. ON-VIABILITY CONTINGENT CAPITAL PROVISION If a non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) trigger event were to occur, for all series of Class A First Preferred Shares excluding the preferred shares issued with res pect to LRCNs, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the respective series of preferred shares at the time of conversion, would be 1.0 billion in aggregate. he LRCNs, by virtue of the recourse to the preferred shares held in the Limited Recourse Trust, include NVCC provisions. For LRCNs, if an NVCC trigger were t o occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares series is sued in connection with such LRCNs, would be 1.1 billion in aggregate. or NVCC subordinated notes and debentures, if an NVCC trigger event were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, as suming there is no accrued and unpaid interest on the respective subordinated notes and debentures, would be 2.7 billion in aggregate.",

As of January 31, 2024, the bank's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios were 13.9%, 15.7%, and 17.6%, respectively, showing a decrease from the previous quarter due to risk-weighted asset growth, share repurchases, and regulatory changes. The leverage ratio remained stable at 4.4%. The bank issued 2 million common shares from treasury without a discount and repurchased 20.9 million shares under a normal course issuer bid. A dividend of $1.02 per common share was approved for the quarter ending April 30, 2024.

The Bank’s goal is to earn a stable and sustainable rate of return for every dollar of risk it takes, while putting significant emphasis on investing in its businesses to meet its future strategic objectives. The Bank’s businesses and operations are exposed to a broad number of risks that have been identified and defined in the Enterprise Risk Framework. The Bank’s tolerance to those risks is defined in the Enterprise Risk Appetite which has been developed within a comprehensive framework that takes into c onsideration current conditions in which the Bank operates and the impact that emerging risks will have on TD’s strategy and risk profile. The Bank’s risk appetite states that it takes risks required to build its business, but only if those risks: (1) fit the business strategy and can be under stood and managed; (2) do not expose the enterprise to any significant single loss events; TD does not ‘bet the bank’ on any single acquisition, business, or product; and (3) do not risk harming the TD brand. Each business is responsible for setting and aligning its individual risk appetites with that of the enterprise based on a thorough examination of the specific risks to which it is exposed. he Bank considers it critical to regularly assess its operating environment and highlight top and emerging risks. These are risks with a potential to have a m aterial effect on the Bank and where the attention of senior leaders is focused due to the potential magnitude or immediacy of their impact. isks are identified, discussed, and actioned by senior leaders and reported quarterly to the Risk Committee. Specific plans to mitigate top and emerging risks are prepared, monitored, and adjusted as required. he Bank’s risk governance structure and risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report. Additional information on risk factors can be found in this document and the 2023 MD&A under the heading “R isk Factors and Management”. For a complete dis cussion of the risk governance structure and the risk management approach, refer to the “Managing Risk” section in the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report. The shaded sections of this MD&A represent a discussion relating to market and liquidity risks and form an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial St atements for the period ended January 31, 2024. Gross credit risk exposure, also referred to as exposure at default (EAD), is the total amount the Bank is exposed to at the time of default of a loan and is measured before counterparty-specific provisions or write-offs. Gross credit risk exposure does not reflect the effects of credit risk mitigation (CRM) and includes bot h on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. On-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of outstanding loans, acceptances, non-trading securities, derivatives, and certain other repo-style transactions. Off-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of undrawn commitments, guarantees, and certain other repo- style transactions.

GMR is determined by creating a distribution of potential changes in the market value of the current portfolio using historical simulation. The Bank values the c urrent portfolio using the market price and rate changes of the most recent 259 trading days for equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity products. GMR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. A one-day holding period is used for GMR calculation. DSR measures idiosyncratic (single-name) credit spread risk for credit exposures in the trading portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. The IDSR model is bas ed on the historical behaviour of five-year idiosyncratic credit spreads. Similar to GMR, IDSR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed more than one out of every 100 trading days. IDSR is measured for a ten-day holding period. he following graph discloses daily one-day VaR usage and trading net revenue, reported on a TEB, within Wholesale Banking. Trading net revenue includes t rading income and net interest income related to positions within the Bank’s market risk cap ital trading books.

        "summary": "The Bank's first-quarter 2024 report outlines its Value-at-Risk (VaR) methodology, which combines General Market Risk (GMR) and Idiosyncratic Debt Specific Risk (IDSR) to assess potential trading portfolio losses. GMR is calculated using historical simulations over a one-day holding period, while IDSR uses Monte Carlo simulations over a ten-day period. For the quarter ending January 31, 2024, the Bank experienced trading losses on four days, but trading net revenue was positive 94% of the time, with no losses exceeding VaR. The report highlights the limitations of VaR, such as its reliance on historical data and assumptions about liquidity, and notes the Bank's use of additional risk metrics like stress testing. The average VaR decreased year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to changes in interest rate risk positions and tighter credit spreads. The report also provides a breakdown of risk measures across different categories, showing a diversification effect that reduces aggregate VaR."

Structural (Non-Trading) Interest Rate Risk he Bank’s structural interest rate risk arises from traditional personal and commercial banking activity and is generally the result of mismatches between the m aturities and repricing dates of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. The measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book does not include exposures from TD’s holesale Banking or Insurance businesses. he primary measures for this risk are Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS). The EVE Sensitivity measures the impact of a specified interest rate shock to the change in the net present value of the Bank’s banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items. It reflects a measurement of the potential present value i mpact on shareholders’ equity without an assumed term profile for the m anagement of the Bank’s own equity and excludes product margins. he NIIS measures the NII change over a twelve-month horizon for a specified change in interest rates for banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off balance sheet items assuming a constant balance sheet over the period. he Bank’s Market Risk policy sets overall limits on the structural interest rate risk measures. These limits are periodically reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee. In addition to the Board policy limits, book-lev el risk limits are set for the Bank’s management of non-t rading interest rate risk by Risk Management. Ex posures against these limits are routinely monitored and reported, and breaches of the Board limits, if any, are escalated to both the Asset/Liability and Capital ommittee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee. The following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rates on the EVE and NIIS m easures. Interest rate floors are applied by currency to the decrease in rates such that they do not exceed expected lower bounds, with the most material c urrencies set to a floor of -25 bps. TABLE 31: STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY MEASURES (millions of Canadian dollars) As at January 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 January 31, 2023 Sensitivity Sensitivity 1 Sensitivity Sensitivity 1 Sensitivity Sensitivity 1 Canada U.S. T otal Canada U.S. T otal Total Total Total Total Before- tax impact of 100 bps increase in rates $ (402) $ (1,734) $ (2,136 ) $ 579 $ 390 $ 969 $ (2,211) $ 920 $ (1,610) $ 1,135 100 bps decre ase in rates 320 1,402 1,722 (605) (547) (1,152) 1,599 (1,099) 1,056 (1,216) 1 Represen ts the twelve-month net interest income (NII) exposure to an immediate and sustained shock in rates. As at January 31, 2024, an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase in interest rates would have had a negative impact to the Bank’s EVE of $2,136 million, a dec rease of $75 million from last quarter, and a positive impact to the Bank’s NII of $969 million, an increase of $49 million from last quarter. An immediate and sustained 100 bps decrease in interest rates would have had a positive impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,722 million, an increase of $123 million from last quarter, and a negative impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,152 million, an increase of $53 million from last quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in up shock EVE Sen sitivity is primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate sensitivity of the Bank’s investment portfolio in the U.S. Region, partially offset by an increase in the duration of net assets supported by equity. The quarter-over-quarter increase in down shock EVE Sensitivity is primarily due to an increase in the duration of net as sets supported by equity. The quarter-over-quarter increase in both up and down shock NII Sensitivity is primarily due to changes in deposit composition and Treasury hedging activity.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first-quarter 2024 report highlights the bank's approach to managing structural interest rate risk, which arises from mismatches in the maturities and repricing dates of its assets and liabilities. The bank uses Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS) as primary measures for this risk. As of January 31, 2024, a 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates would negatively impact the bank's EVE by $2,136 million but positively impact its NII by $969 million. Conversely, a 100 bps decrease would positively impact EVE by $1,722 million but negatively affect NII by $1,152 million. Changes in these sensitivities from the previous quarter are attributed to adjustments in the interest rate sensitivity of the bank's U.S. investment portfolio and changes in deposit composition and Treasury hedging activities. The bank's market risk policy sets limits on these measures, which are monitored and reported regularly."

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 33 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient cash or collateral to meet financial obligations and an inability to, in a timely manner, raise funding or monetize assets at a non-distressed price. Financial obligations can arise from deposit withdrawals, debt maturities, commitments to provide credit or liquidity support, or the need to pledge additional collateral. TD’S LIQUIDITY RISK APPETITE The Bank applies an established set of practices and protocols for managing its potential exposure to liquidity risk. The Bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under a combined bank-specific and market-wide stress scenario, and a minimum buffer over regulatory requirements prescribed by the OSFI Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) guidelines. Under the LAR guidelines, Canadian banks are required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at the minimum of 100% other than during periods of financial stress and to maintain a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at the minimum of 100%. The Bank’s funding program emphasizes maximizing deposits as a core source of funding, and having ready access to wholesale funding markets across diversified terms, funding types, and currencies that is designed to ensure low exposure to a sudden contraction of wholesale funding capacity and to minimize structural liquidity gaps. The Bank also maintains a contingency funding plan to enhance preparedness for recovery from potential liquidity stress events. The Bank’s strategies and actions comprise an integrated liquidity risk management program that is designed to ensure low exposure to liquidity risk and compliance with regulatory requirements. The Bank’s ALCO oversees the Bank’s liquidity risk management program. It ensures there are effective management structures and practices in place to properly measure and manage liquidity risk. The Global Liquidity & Funding Committee, a subcommittee of the ALCO comprised of senior management from Treasury, Risk Management and Wholesale Banking, identifies and monitors the Bank’s liquidity risks. The management of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the SET member responsible for Treasury, while oversight and challenge is provided by the ALCO and independently by Risk Management. The Risk Committee regularly reviews the Bank’s liquidity position and approves the Bank’s Liquidity Risk Management Framework bi-annually and the related policies annually. The Bank has established TDGUS as TD’s U.S. IHC, as well as a Combined U.S. Operations (CUSO) reporting unit that consists of the IHC and TD’s U.S. branch and agency network. Both TDGUS and CUSO are managed to the U.S. Enhanced Prudential Standards liquidity requirements in addition to the Bank’s liquidity management framework. The Bank’s liquidity risk appetite and liquidity risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report. For a complete discussion of liquidity risk, refer to the “Liquidity Risk” section in the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report. Liquid assets The unencumbered liquid assets the Bank holds to meet its liquidity requirements must be high-quality securities that the Bank believes can be monetized quickly in stress conditions with minimum loss in market value. The liquidity value of unencumbered liquid assets considers estimated market or trading depths, settlement timing, and/or other identified impediments to potential sale or pledging. Assets held by the Bank to meet liquidity requirements are summarized in the following tables. The tables do not include assets held within the Bank’s insurance businesses as these are used to support insurance-specific liabilities and capital requirements.

This category includes re ported FHLB assets that remain unutilized and DSAC that are available for collateral purposes however not regularly utilized in practice. 6 Assets that cannot be used to support funding or collateral requirements in their current form. This category includes those assets that are potentially eligible as funding program collateral or for pledging to central banks (for example, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation insured mortgages that can be securitized into NHA MBS ). 7 I ncludes trading loans, securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL and other financial assets designated at FVTPL, financial assets at FVOCI, and DSAC. 8 Assets reported i n the “Bank-owned assets” column represent the value of the loans extended and not the value of the collateral received. The loan value from the reverse repurchase transactions is deducted from the “ Securities receive d as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double-counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 9 The loan value from the margin loans/client activity is deducted from the “Securities r eceived as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions ” column to avoid double counting with the on-balance sheet assets. 10 Other assets include investment in Schwab, goodwill, other intangibles, land, buildings, equipment, and other depreciable a ssets, deferred tax assets, amounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, and other assets on the balance sheet not reported in the above categories. In addition to the Severe Combined Stress Scenario, the Bank performs liquidity stress testing on multiple alternate scenarios. These scenarios are a mix of TD s pecific events and market-wide stress events designed to test the impact from ris k factors material to the Bank’s risk profile. Liquidity assessments are also part of the Bank’s Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing program. he Bank has liquidity contingency funding plans (CFP) in place at the overall Bank level and for certain subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions (Regional FPs). The Bank’s CFP provides a documented framework for managing unexpected liquidity situations and thus is an integral component of the Bank’s overall liquidity risk management program. It outlines different contingency levels based on the severity and duration of the liquidity situation and identifies recovery ac tions appropriate for each level. For each recovery action, it provides key operational steps required to execute the action. Regional CFPs identify recovery ac tions to address region-specific stress events. The actions and governance structure outlined in the Bank’s CFP are aligned with the Bank’s Crisis Management Recovery Plan. Credit ratings impact the Bank’s borrowing costs and ability to raise funds. Rating downgrades could potentially result in higher financing costs, increased requirements to pledge collateral, re duced access to capital markets, and could also affect the Bank’s ability to enter into derivative transactions. redit ratings and outlooks provided by rating agencies reflect their views and are subject to change from time to time, based on a number of factors including t he Bank’s financial strength, competitive position, and liquidity, as well as factors not entirely within the Bank’s control, including the methodologies used by rating agencies and conditions affecting the overall financial services industry.",

The Bank regularly reviews the level of increased collateral its trading counterparties would require in t he event of a downgrade of TD’s credit rating. The Bank hold s liquid assets to ensure it is able to provide additional collateral required by trading counterparties in the event of a three-notch downgrade in the Bank’s s enior debt ratings. The following table presents the additional collateral that could have been contractually required to be posted to OTC derivative counterparties as of the reporting date in the event of one, two, and three-notch downgrades of the Bank’s credit ratings.

These activiti es include clearing, custody, or cash management services. 7 Includes uncommitted credit and liquidity facilities, stable value money market mutual funds, outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, and other contractual cash outflows. With respect to outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, TD has no contractual obligation to buy back these outstanding TD debt securities, and as a result, a 0% outflow rate is applied under the OSFI LAR guideline. 8 Total HQLA includes both asset haircuts and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (HQLA assets after haircuts are capped at 40% for Level 2 and 15% for Level 2B). 9 Total Net Cash Outflows include both inflow and outflow rates and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (inflows are capped at 75% of outflows). he Bank’s average LCR of 133% for the quarter ended January 31, 2024 continues to meet the regulatory requirements. The Bank holds a variety of liquid assets commensurate with the liquidity needs of the organization. Many of these assets qualify as HQLA under the OSFI LAR guideline. The average HQLA of the Bank for the quarter ended January 31, 2024 was $334 billion (October 31, 2023 – $325 billion), with Level 1 assets representing 83% (October 31, 2023 – 82%). The Bank’s reported HQLA excludes excess HQLA from the U.S. Retail operations, as required by the OSFI LAR guideline, to reflect liquidity transfer considerations between U.S. Retail and its affiliates as a result of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s regulations. B y excluding excess HQLA, the U.S. Retail LCR is effectively capped at 100% prior to total Bank consolidation. As described in the “How TD Manages Liquidity Risk” section of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report, the Bank manages its HQLA and other liquidity buffers to the higher of TD’s 90-d ay surplus requirement and the target buffers over regulatory requirements from the LCR, NSFR, and the Net Cumulative Cash Flow metrics. As a result, the total stock of HQLA is subject to ongoing rebalancing against the projected liquidity requirements. The NSFR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of total available stable funding (ASF) over total required stable funding (RSF) in accordance with OSFI’s guideline. The Bank must maintain an NSFR ratio equal to or above 100% in accordance with the LAR guideline. The Bank’s ASF comprises the Bank’s liability and capital instruments (including deposits and wholesale funding). The assets that require stable fund ing are based on the Bank’s on and off-bal ance sheet activities and a function of their liquidity characteristics and the requirements of OSFI’s LAR guideline.

As such, the only interdependent assets and liabilities that qualify for this treatment at the Bank are the liabilities arising from the Canada Mortgage Bonds Program and their corresponding encumbered ass ets. 6 Includes Residential Mortgages and HELOCs. he Bank’s NSFR for the quarter ended January 31, 2024 is at 114% (October 31, 2023 – 117%) representing a surplus of $135 billion adhering to regulatory requirements.

ATURITY ANALYSIS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet categories by remaining contractual maturity. Off-balance sheet commitments include c ontractual obligations to make future payments on certain lease-related commitments, certain purchase obligations, and other liabilities. The values of credit ins truments reported in the following table represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the Bank could be obligated to extend should such instruments be fully drawn or utilized. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contractual am ounts is not representative of expected future liquidity requirements. These contractual obligations have an impact on the B ank’s short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The maturity analysis presented does not depict the degree of the Bank’s maturity transformation or the Bank’s exposure to int erest rate and liquidity risk. The Ban k’s objective is to fund its assets appropriately to protect against borrowing cost volatility and potential reductions to funding market availability. The Bank ut ilizes stable non-maturity deposits (chequing and savings accounts) and term deposits as the primary source of long-term fundi ng for the Bank’s non-trading as sets including personal and business term loans and the stable balance of revolving lines of credit. Additionally, the Bank issues long-term funding in respect of s uch non-trading assets and raises short term funding primarily to finance trading assets. The liquidity of trading assets under stressed market conditions is c onsidered when determining the appropriate term of the funding.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first-quarter 2024 report highlights its diversified funding strategy, emphasizing a mix of unsecured and secured sources. The bank primarily relies on personal and commercial deposits, which constitute about 70% of its total funding. As of January 31, 2024, Canadian and U.S. P&C deposits totaled approximately $958.9 billion. The bank also maintains various wholesale funding programs, including securitization, covered bonds, and unsecured debt, diversified by geography and currency. Long-term funding is primarily in U.S. dollars (34%) and Canadian dollars (27%), with senior unsecured medium-term notes and covered bonds being the main funding types. The bank manages depositor concentration and maturity concentration to mitigate liquidity and refinancing risks. Additionally, the bank's funding strategy aims to align asset funding with appropriate terms to protect against borrowing cost volatility and ensure liquidity under stressed conditions."

        "chunk": "D BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 44 REGULATORY AND STANDARD SETTER DEVELOPMENTS CONCERNING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL (E&S) RISK (INCLUDING CLIMATE) On March 7, 2023, OSFI issued Final Guideline B-15: Climate Risk Management (Guideline B-15), which sets out OSFI’s expectations related to the management and disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities. Guideline B-15 is iterative and is currently organized into interrelated and mutually reinforcing chapters, Chapter 1 – Governance and Risk Management Expectations and Chapter 2 – Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Components of Guideline B-15 are initially effective for D-SIBs for fiscal year-end 2024, where annual disclosures are required to be made publicly available no later than 180 days after fiscal year-end. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopting Guideline B-15. ISSB – IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 On June 26, 2023, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the IFRS Foundation, issued its first two sustainability standards, IFRS S1, General Requirements for Disclosures of Sustainability-related Financial Information (S1) and IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures (S2). S1 sets out the disclosure requirements for financially material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities to meet investor information needs, and S2 specifically sets the disclosure requirement for climate-related risks and opportunities. The ISSB recommends an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, this is subject to Canadian jurisdiction’s endorsement. Early application is permitted on or before the date of initial application of IFRS S1 and S2. The International Organization of Securities Commissions has endorsed IFRS S1 and S2 on July 23, 2023, and is now calling its member jurisdictions to consider ways they may adopt or apply the ISSB standards. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopting these standards. SECURITIZATION AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Bank enters into securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations. The Bank is involved with structured entities (SEs) that it sponsors, as well as entities sponsored by third parties. Refer to “Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section, Note 9: Transfers of Financial Assets and Note 10: Structured Entities of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Report for further details. There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended January 31, 2024. Securitization of Third Party-Originated Assets Significant Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities The Bank securitizes third party-originated assets through Bank-sponsored SEs, including its Canadian multi-seller conduits which are not consolidated. These Canadian multi-seller conduits securitize Canadian originated third-party assets. The Bank administers these multi-seller conduits and provides liquidity facilities as well as securities distribution services; it may also provide credit enhancements. TD’s total potential exposure to loss through the provision of liquidity facilities for multi-seller conduits was $15.7 billion as at January 31, 2024 (October 31, 2023 – $15.2 billion). As at January 31, 2024, the Bank had funded exposure of $14.1 billion under such liquidity facilities relating to outstanding issuances of asset-backed commercial paper (October 31, 2023 – $13.3 billion). The Bank’s unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. For details of the Bank’s accounting policies under IFRS, refer to Note 2 of the Bank’s first quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. For details of the Bank’s significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions under IFRS, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s first quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. The following new standard has been adopted by the Bank on November 1, 2023. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) which replaced the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) and became effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which was November 1, 2023 for the Bank. IFRS 17 establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk-adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The liabilities presented by insurance groups are comprised of the liability for remaining coverage (LRC) and the liability for incurred claims (LIC) and are reported as Insurance contract liabilities on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet. The LRC is the obligation to investigate and pay claims that have not yet occurred and includes the loss component related to onerous contract groups. The LIC is the estimate of claims incurred, including claims that have occurred but have not been reported, and related insurance costs. IFRS 17 introduces two measurement models that are applicable to the Bank, the premium allocation approach model (PAA) and the general measurement model (GMM). The Bank measures the majority of its insurance contract groups using the PAA, which includes property and casualty contracts as well as short-term life and health contracts. The PAA is a simplified model applied to insurance contracts that are either one year or less or where the PAA approximates the GMM. Contracts using the GMM are longer-term life and health contracts. The LRC for insurance contract groups using the PAA is measured as unearned premiums less deferred acquisition cash flows allocated to the group. The LRC is adjusted for the recognition of insurance revenue and amortization of acquisition cash flows reported in insurance service expenses on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the underlying insurance contracts, usually twelve months. The LRC for longer term contracts using the GMM model is measured using estimates and assumptions that reflect the timing and uncertainty of insurance cash flows. When a group of contracts is expected to be onerous, a loss component (expected loss related to fulfilling the related insurance contracts) is established which increases the LRC and insurance service expenses. The loss component of the LRC is subsequently recognized in income over the contractual term of the underlying insurance contracts to offset claims incurred and related expenses. The Bank measures the LIC at the present value of current estimates of claims and related costs for insurable events occurring at or before the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet date. The LIC includes a risk adjustment, which represents the compensation the Bank requires for bearing the uncertainty related to non-financial risks in its fulfilment of insurance contracts. Expenses related to claims incurred and related costs are reported in insurance service expenses and changes related to discounting the liability are recorded as insurance finance income or expenses in other income (loss). Prior to the adoption of IFRS 17, these expenses were recorded in insurance claims and related expenses and non-interest expenses.",
        "summary": "The financial text outlines several key developments and updates for D Bank Group in the first quarter of 2024:\n\n1. **Climate Risk Management**: The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) issued Guideline B-15 on March 7, 2023, which outlines expectations for managing and disclosing climate-related risks and opportunities. This guideline is effective for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) by fiscal year-end 2024, with public disclosures required within 180 days post-year-end. The bank is assessing the impact of this guideline.\n\n2. **Sustainability Standards**: The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) released its first two standards, IFRS S1 and IFRS S2, on June 26, 2023. These standards focus on sustainability-related and climate-related financial disclosures, respectively, with a recommended effective date of January 1, 2024. The bank is evaluating the adoption of these standards.\n\n3. **Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**: The bank continues its involvement in securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements, including Canadian multi-seller conduits. As of January 31, 2024, the bank's potential exposure through liquidity facilities was $15.7 billion, with a funded exposure of $14.1 billion.\n\n4. **Insurance Contracts**: The bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts, on November 1, 2023. This standard replaces IFRS 4 and introduces new principles for recognizing, measuring, presenting, and disclosing insurance contracts. The bank primarily uses the Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) for short-term contracts and the General Measurement Model (GMM) for longer-term contracts. The adoption of IFRS 17 changes how insurance liabilities and related expenses are reported.\n\nOverall, the text highlights the bank's ongoing adjustments to regulatory and accounting standards, particularly concerning climate risk management, sustainability disclosures, and insurance contract accounting."

Refer to Note 13 o f the Bank’s first quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements f or further details on the results of ins urance and reinsurance contracts. he Bank initially applied IFRS 17 on November 1, 2023 and restated the comparative period. The Bank transitioned by primarily applying the full retrospective approa ch which resulted in the measurement of insurance contracts as if IFRS 17 had always applied to them. The following table sets out adjustments to the Ban k’s insurance-related balances reported under IFRS 4 as at October 31, 2022 used to derive the insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance contract assets rec ognized by the Bank as at November 1, 2022 under IFRS 17. (m illions of Canadian dollars) A mount Insurance-related liabilities $ 7, 468 Other liabilities 131 Other assets (2,361) Net insurance-related balances as at October 31, 2022 $ 5, 238 Changes in actuarial assumptions, including risk adjustment and discount factor (192) ecognition of losses on onerous contracts 113 Ot her adjustments (93) et insurance-related balances as at November 1, 2022 $ 5, 066 Insurance contract liabilities $ 5,761 Reinsurance contract assets (695) et insurance-related balances as at November 1, 2022 $ 5, 066 On November 1, 2022, IFRS 17 transition adjustments resulted in a decrease to the Bank’s deferred tax assets of $60 million and an after-tax increase to retained earnings of $112 million. pon the initial application of IFRS 17 on November 1, 2023, the Bank applied transitional guidance and reclassified certain securities supporting insurance opera tions to minimize accounting mismatches arising from the application of the new discount factor under IFRS 17. The transitional guidance for such securities is applicable for entities that previously used IFRS 9, Financial Instruments and was applied without a restatement of comparatives. The reclassification resulted in a decrease to retained earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $10 million. CCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s polic ies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and c hanges to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financi al Statements. The Bank has es tablished procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adop ting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. mpairment – Expected Credit Loss Model he ECL model requires the application of estimates and judgment in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. There remains elev ated economic uncertainty, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in c redit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the m odel calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. Insurance Contracts The assumptions used in establishing the Bank’s insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are based on best estimates of possible outcomes. For property and casualty insurance contracts, the ultimate cost of LIC is estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques in accordance with Canadian accepted actuarial practices. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in t he future, in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate claims cost amounts that present the most likely outcome taking into account all the uncertainties involved. or life and health insurance contracts, actuarial liabilities consider all future policy cash flows, including premiums, claims, and expenses required to administer t he policies. Critical assumptions used in the measurement of life and health insurance contract liabilities are determined by the appointed actuary. urther information on insurance risk assumptions is provided in Note 13 of the Bank’s first quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no new or amended material accounting policies that have been issued, but are not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim onsolidated Financial Statements. During the most recent interim period, there have been no changes in the Bank’s policies and procedures and other processes that comprise its internal control ov er financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting. Refer to ote 2 and Note 3 of the Bank’s first quarter 2024 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bank’s changes to accounting policies, procedures, and estimates.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first quarter 2024 report highlights the implementation of IFRS 17 on November 1, 2023, which required restating comparative periods and applying a full retrospective approach to insurance contracts. This transition led to adjustments in insurance-related balances, including a decrease in deferred tax assets by $60 million and an after-tax increase in retained earnings by $112 million. The bank also reclassified certain securities to minimize accounting mismatches, resulting in a $10 million decrease in retained earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. The report emphasizes the importance of accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions, particularly in the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model and insurance contracts. No new or amended material accounting policies were issued, and there were no significant changes in internal control over financial reporting during the interim period.

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 46 Financial and Banking Terms Adjusted Results: Non-GAAP financial measures used to assess each of the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note”, from reported results. The items of note relate to items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying busi ness performance. Allowance for Credit Losses: Represent expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. Allowance for credit losses consists of Stage 3 allowance for impaired financial assets and Stage 2 and Stage 1 allowance for performing financial assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals, and impacted by foreign exchange. Amortized Cost: The amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization, using EIRM, of any differences between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. Assets under Administration (AUA): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers where the Bank provides services of an administrative nature, such as the collection of investment income and the placing of trades on behalf of the clients (where the client has made his or her own investment selection). The majority of these assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets under Management (AUM): Assets that are beneficially owned by customers, managed by the Bank, where the Bank has discretion to make investment selections on behalf of the client (in accordance with an investment policy). In addition to the TD family of mutual funds, the Bank manages assets on behalf of individuals, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments and foundations. These assets are not reported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Some assets under management that are also administered by the Bank are included in assets under administration. Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP): A form of commercial paper that is collateralized by other financial assets. Institutional investors usually purchase such instruments in order to diversify their assets and generate short-term gains. Asset-Backed Securities (ABS): A security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or “backed”) by a specified pool of underlying assets. Average Common Equity: Average common equity for the business segments reflects the average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its busi ness segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Average Interest-Earning Assets: A non-GAAP financial measure that depicts the Bank’s financial position, and is calculated as the average carrying value of deposits with banks, loans and securities based on daily balances for the period ending October 31 in each fiscal year. Basic Earnings per Share (EPS): A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted basic EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Basis Points (bps): A unit equal to 1/100 of 1%. Thus, a 1% change is equal to 100 basis points. Book Value per Share: A measure calculated by dividing common shareholders’ equity by number of common shares at the end of the period. Carrying Value: The value at which an asset or liability is carried at on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO): They are collateralized debt obligations consisting of mortgage-backed securities that are separated and issued as different classes of mortgage pass-through securities with different terms, interest rates, and risks. CMOs by private issuers are collectively referred to as non-agency CMOs. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: This is a primary Basel III capital measure comprised mainly of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. Regulatory deductions made to arrive at the CET1 Capital include goodwill and intangibles, unconsolidated investments in banking, financial, and insurance entities, deferred tax assets, defined benefit pension fund assets, and shortfalls in allowances. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio: CET1 Capital ratio represents the predominant measure of capital adequacy under Basel III and equals CET1 Capital divided by RWA. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): A measure of growth over multiple time periods from the initial investment value to the ending investment value assuming that the investment has been compounding over the time period. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA): CVA represents a capital charge that measures credit risk due to default of derivative counterparties. This charge requires banks to capitalize for the potential changes in counterparty credit spread for the derivative portfolios. Diluted EPS: A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusting for the effect of all potentially dilutive common shares. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Payout Ratio: A ratio represents the percentage of Bank’s ea rnings being paid to common shareholders in the form of dividends and is calculated by dividing common dividends by net income available to common shareholders. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Yield: A ratio calculated as the dividend per common share for the year divided by the daily average closing stock price during the year. Effective Income Tax Rate: A rate and performance indicator calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes as a percentage of net income before taxes. Adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated in the same manner using adjusted results. Ef fective Interest Rate (EIR): The rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The calculation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts. Ef fective Interest Rate Method (EIRM): A technique for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument’s book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Under EIRM, the effective interest rate, which is a key component of the calculation, discounts the expected future cash inflows and outflows expected over the life of a financial instrument. Ef ficiency Ratio: The efficiency ratio measures operating efficiency and is calculated by taking the non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue. A lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio, net of insurance service expenses (ISE) is calculated by dividing adjusted non-interest expenses by adjusted total revenue, net of ISE. Management believes presenting efficiency ratio net of ISE is aligned with industry reporting and allows for better assessment of operating results.",

Expected Credit Losses (ECLs): ECLs are the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions that impact the Bank’s credit risk assessment. Fair Value: The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Under IFRS 9, if the asset passes the contractual cash flows test (named SPPI), the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classified. If the instrument is being held to collect contractual cash flows, that is, if it is not expected to be sold, it is measured as amortized cost. If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is measured at FVOCI. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Under IFRS 9, the classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI) and a business model assessment. Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in profit or loss. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): A U.S. government corporation which provides deposit insurance guaranteeing the safety of a depositor’s accounts in member banks. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in receivership (failed banks). Forward Contracts: Over-the-counter contracts between two parties that oblige one party to the contract to buy and the other party to sell an asset for a fixed price at a future date. Futures: Exchange-traded contracts to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Hedging: A risk management technique intended to mitigate the Bank’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other market factors. The elimination or reduction of such exposure is accomplished by engaging in capital markets activities to establish offsetting positions. Impaired Loans: Loans where, in management’s opinion, there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent that the Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. Loss Given Default (LGD): It is the amount of the loss the Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a loan, which is expressed as a percentage of exposure at default. Mark-to-Market (MTM): A valuation that reflects current market rates as at the balance sheet date for financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Master Netting Agreements: Legal agreements between two parties that have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default or termination of any one contract. Net Corporate Expenses: Non-interest expenses related to corporate service and control groups which are not allocated to a business segment. Net Interest Margin: A non-GAAP ratio calculated as net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to measure performance. This metric is an indicator of the profitability of the Bank’s earning assets less the cost of funding. Adjusted net interest margin is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net interest income. Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC): Instruments (preferred shares and subordinated debt) that contain a feature or a provision that allows the financial institution to either permanently convert these instruments into common shares or fully write-down the instrument, in the event that the institution is no longer viable. Notional: A reference amount on which payments for derivative financial instruments are based. Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI): The regulator of Canadian federally chartered financial institutions and federally administered pension plans. Options: Contracts in which the writer of the option grants the buyer the future right, but not the obligation, to buy or to sell a security, exchange rate, interest rate, or other financial instrument or commodity at a predetermined price at or by a specified future date. Price-Earnings Ratio: A ratio calculated by dividing the closing share price by EPS based on a trailing four quarters to indicate market performance. Adjusted price-earnings ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted EPS. Probability of Default (PD): It is the likelihood that a borrower will not be able to meet its scheduled repayments. Provision for Credit Losses (PCL): Amount added to the allowance for credit losses to bring it to a level that management considers adequate to reflect expected credit-related losses on its portfolio. Return on Common Equity (ROE): The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common shareholders’ equity, utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. Adjusted ROE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Return on Risk-weighted Assets: Net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average risk-weighted assets. Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a percentage of average Tangible common equity. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Both measures can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA): Assets calculated by applying a regulatory risk-weight factor to on and off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight factors are established by the OSFI to convert on and off-balance sheet exposures to a comparable risk level. Securitization: The process by which financial assets, mainly loans, are transferred to structures, which normally issue a series of asset-backed securities to investors to fund the purchase of loans. Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI): IFRS 9 requires that the following criteria be met in order for a financial instrument to be classified at amortized cost: • The entity’s business model relates to managing financial assets (such as bank trading activity), and, as such, an asset is held with the intention of collecting its contractual cash flows; and • An asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.",

It can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equity. Taxable Equivalent Basis (TEB): A calculation method (not defined in GAAP) that increases revenues and the provision for income taxes on certain tax exempt securities to an equivalent before-tax basis to facilitate comparison of net interest income from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Tier 1 Capital Ratio: Tier 1 Capital represents the more permanent forms of capital, consisting primarily of common shareholders’ equity, retained earnings, preferred shares and innovative instruments.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first-quarter 2024 financial report highlights several key insights:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet Overview**: Total assets decreased slightly from $1,955 billion in October 2023 to $1,911 billion in January 2024. Cash and due from banks also decreased, while loans net of allowance for loan losses increased marginally.\n\n2. **Income Statement Highlights**: Net income for the quarter was $2,824 million, a significant increase from $1,581 million in the same quarter of the previous year. This was driven by higher interest income, which rose from $18,056 million to $22,813 million, despite an increase in interest expenses.\n\n3. **Equity and Liabilities**: Total liabilities decreased from $1,843 billion to $1,798 billion, while total equity increased slightly to $112 billion. The bank's retained earnings decreased slightly, but accumulated other comprehensive income improved.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Income**: Total comprehensive income rose to $3,740 million from $1,568 million, with significant contributions from net income and other comprehensive income, particularly gains on derivatives and foreign currency translation.\n\n5. **Cash Flow Activities**: The bank experienced a net cash outflow from operating activities of $20,112 million, primarily due to changes in deposits and loans. Financing activities also saw a net outflow, while investing activities generated a net inflow of $23,447 million, largely from interest-bearing deposits with banks.\n\n6. **IFRS 17 Adoption**: The financial statements reflect adjustments due to the adoption of IFRS 17, impacting various components, including retained earnings and comprehensive income.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group showed strong profitability growth in the first quarter of 2024, with increased net income and comprehensive income, despite a decrease in total assets and cash flows from operating activities."

        "chunk": "l s TD BANK GROUP • FIRST QUARTER 2024 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 54 NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) NOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS The Toronto-Dominion Bank is a bank chartered under the Bank Act (Canada). The shareholders of a bank are not, as shareholders, liable for any liability, act, or default of the bank except as otherwise provided under the Bank Act (Canada). The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group (“TD” or the “Bank”). The Bank was formed through the amalgamation on February 1, 1955, of The Bank of Toronto (chartered in 1855) and The Dominion Bank (chartered in 1869). The Bank is incorporated and domiciled in Canada with its registered and principal business offices located at 66 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario. TD serves customers in four business segments operating in a number of locations in key financial centres around the globe: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The accompanying Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting principles followed by the Bank have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including the accounting requirements of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI). The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated. These Interim Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared on a condensed basis in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting using the accounting policies as described in Note 2 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 2 of this report. Certain comparative amounts have been revised to conform with the presentation adopted in the current period. The preparation of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements requires that management make judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as further described in Note 3 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 3 of this report. Accordingly, actual results may differ from estimated amounts as future confirming events occur. The Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. All intercompany transactions, balances, and unrealized gains and losses on transactions are eliminated on consolidation. The Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended January 31, 2024, were approved and authorized for issue by the Bank’s Board of Directors, in accordance with a recommendation of the Audit Committee, on February 28, 2024. As the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of the disclosures normally provided in the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, they should be read in conjunction with the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes, and the shaded sections of the 2023 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The risk management policies and procedures of the Bank are provided in the MD&A. The shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the MD&A in this report, relating to market, liquidity, and insurance risks, are an integral part of these Interim Consolidated Financial Statements, as permitted by IFRS. NOTE 2: CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following new standard has been adopted by the Bank on November 1, 2023. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) which replaced the guidance in IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) and became effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which was November 1, 2023 for the Bank. IFRS 17 establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the risk-adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The liabilities presented by insurance groups are comprised of the liability for remaining coverage (LRC) and the liability for incurred claims (LIC) and are reported as Insurance contract liabilities on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet. The LRC is the obligation to investigate and pay claims that have not yet occurred and includes the loss component related to onerous contract groups. The LIC is the estimate of claims incurred, including claims that have occurred but have not been reported, and related insurance costs. IFRS 17 introduces two measurement models that are applicable to the Bank, the premium allocation approach model (PAA) and the general measurement mode (GMM). The Bank measures the majority of its insurance contract groups using the PAA, which includes property and casualty contracts as well as short-term life and hea lth contracts. The PAA is a simplified model applied to insurance contracts that are either one year or less or where the PAA approximates the GMM. Contracts using the GMM are longer-term life and health contracts. The LRC for insurance contract groups using the PAA is measured as unearned premiums les deferred acquisition cash flows allocated to the group. The LRC is adjusted for the recognition of insurance revenue and amortization of acquisition cash flows reported in insurance service expenses on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the underlying insurance contracts, usually twelve months. The LRC for longer term contracts using the GMM model is measured using estimates and assumptions that reflect the timing and uncertainty of insurance cash flows. When a group of contracts is expected to be onerous, a loss component (expected loss related to fulfilling the related insurance contracts) is established which increase s the LRC and insurance service expenses. The loss component of the LRC is subsequently recognized in income over the contractual term of the underlying insurance contracts to offset claims incurred and related expenses. The Bank measures the LIC at the present value of current estimates of claims and related costs for insurable events occurring at or before the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet date. The LIC includes a risk adjustment, which represents the compensation the Bank requires for bearing the uncertainty related to non-financial risks in its fulfilment of insurance contracts. Expenses related to claims incurred and related costs are reported in insurance service expenses and changes related to discounting the liability are recorded as insurance finance income or expenses in other income (loss). Prior to the adoption of IFRS 17, these expenses were recorded in insurance claims and related expenses and non-interest expenses.",
        "summary": "The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank Group) has released its unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the first quarter of 2024, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The report highlights the adoption of IFRS 17, a new standard for insurance contracts, effective November 1, 2023. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 and introduces principles for recognizing, measuring, presenting, and disclosing insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are grouped and measured at the risk-adjusted present value of cash flows. The Bank primarily uses the Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) for short-term contracts and the General Measurement Model (GMM) for longer-term contracts. The report also notes that the liabilities for insurance contracts are divided into the liability for remaining coverage (LRC) and the liability for incurred claims (LIC). The adoption of IFRS 17 changes how insurance-related expenses are recorded, moving them from insurance claims and related expenses to insurance service expenses and insurance finance income or expenses. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on February 28, 2024, and should be read in conjunction with the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)."

Upon the initial application of IFRS 17 on November 1, 2023, the Bank applied transitional guidance and reclassified certain securities supporting insurance opera tions to minimize accounting mismatches arising from the application of the new discount factor under IFRS 17. The transitional guidance for such securities is applicable for entities that previously used IFRS 9, Financial Instruments and was applied without a restatement of comparatives. The reclassification resulted in a decrease to retained earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of $10 million. here were no new or amended material accounting policies that have been issued, but are not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim onsolidated Financial Statements. OTE 3: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in the Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understanding its results of operations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and c hanges to accounting standards and policies could have a material impact on the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established proc edures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated inancial Statements for a description of significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The expected credit loss (ECL) model requires the application of judgments, estimates, and assumptions in the assessment of the current and forward-looking ec onomic environment. There remains elevated economic uncertainty, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. Insurance Contracts The assumptions used in establishing the Bank’s insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are based on best estimates of possible outcomes. or property and casualty insurance contracts, the ultimate cost of LIC is estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques in ac cordance with Canadian accepted actuarial practices. Additional qualitative judgment is used to assess the extent to which past trends may or may not apply in t he future, in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate claims cost amounts that present the most likely outcome taking into account all the uncertainties involved. or life and health insurance contracts, actuarial liabilities consider all future policy cash flows, including premiums, claims, and expenses required to administer t he policies. Critical assumptions used in the measurement of life and health insurance contract liabilities are determined by the appointed actuary. urther information on insurance risk assumptions is provided in Note 13.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first quarter 2024 report highlights the implementation of IFRS 17 on November 1, 2023, which required restating comparative periods and applying a full retrospective approach to insurance contracts. This transition led to adjustments in insurance-related balances, including a decrease in deferred tax assets by $60 million and an after-tax increase in retained earnings by $112 million. The bank also reclassified certain securities to minimize accounting mismatches, resulting in a $10 million decrease in retained earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income. The report emphasizes the importance of significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions, particularly in the expected credit loss model and insurance contracts. The bank uses actuarial techniques and expert judgment to estimate liabilities and claims costs, considering economic uncertainties and future policy cash flows."

Key points include:\n\n1. **Fair Value Measurements**: There were no significant changes in the methodologies for determining fair value measurements for the quarter ending January 31, 2024. The report details the fair value of financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, with slight decreases in both carrying and fair values compared to October 31, 2023.\n\n2. **Fair Value Hierarchy**: The report categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into levels 1, 2, and 3, with no significant transfers between these levels during the quarter. Level 3 assets and liabilities, which use unobservable inputs, showed minor changes in fair value.\n\n3. **Unrealized Gains and Losses**: The report summarizes unrealized gains and losses for securities at fair value through other comprehensive income, noting a decrease in unrealized losses from October 31, 2023, to January 31, 2024.\n\n4. **Credit Quality**: The bank evaluates non-retail credit risk using borrower and facility risk ratings. The majority of debt securities are investment grade, with minimal allowance for credit losses.\n\n5. **Loans and Acceptances**: Total loans and acceptances increased slightly from October 31, 2023, with residential mortgages and business loans being the largest components. The allowance for loan losses also saw a minor increase.\n\nOverall, the report indicates stable financial management with slight adjustments in asset and liability valuations and a focus on maintaining credit quality."

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's First Quarter 2024 report highlights the credit quality of its loan portfolio. The bank manages retail exposures using predictive credit scoring and non-retail exposures with a Borrower Risk Rating (BRR) system. As of January 31, 2024, the total gross carrying amount of loans and acceptances was CAD 925.3 billion, with allowances for loan losses totaling CAD 7.3 billion. The report categorizes loans into stages based on risk, with Stage 1 being low risk and Stage 3 being high risk or default. The bank's allowance for credit losses increased slightly from the previous quarter, reflecting a cautious approach to potential defaults. The report also details off-balance sheet credit instruments, which amounted to CAD 738.4 billion, with an allowance for losses of CAD 1 billion. Overall, the bank maintains a robust risk management framework to handle credit exposures across various risk levels."

(e) FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION elevant macroeconomic factors are incorporated in risk parameters as appropriate. Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also incorporated, where relevant. The key macroeconomic variables used in determining ECLs include regional unemployment rates for all retail exposures and regional housing price indices for residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. For business and government loans, the key macroeconomic variables inc lude gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, and credit spreads. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial tatements for a discussion of how forward-looking information is generated and considered in determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit ris k and in measuring ECLs. Macroeconomic Variables Select macroeconomic variables are projected over the forecast period. The following table sets out average values of the macroeconomic variables over the four c alendar quarters starting with the current quarter, and the remaining 4-year forecast period for the base forecast and upside and downside scenarios used in det ermining the Bank’s ECLs as at January 31, 2024. As the forecast period increases, information about the future becomes less readily available and projections are anchored on assumptions around structural relationships between economic parameters that are inherently much less certain. Restrictive monetary policy is c ontributing to elevated economic uncertainty, particularly in Canada where household debt levels remain elevated, and is likely to lead to a near-term deceleration in economic growth and a modest increase in unemployment rate.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's first-quarter 2024 report provides a detailed analysis of the allowance for loan losses by stage, comparing figures from January 31, 2024, to January 31, 2023. The report highlights changes in provisions for credit losses across different loan categories, including residential mortgages, consumer installment and other personal loans, credit cards, and business and government loans. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Allowance for Loan Losses**: There is an increase in the total allowance for loan losses from $6.492 billion in 2023 to $7.265 billion in 2024, indicating a higher provision for potential credit losses.\n\n2. **Stage Transfers**: The report details stage transfers, which reflect changes in credit risk, with significant movements between stages 1, 2, and 3 across all loan categories.\n\n3. **Macroeconomic Factors**: The report incorporates forward-looking information, considering macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, GDP, home prices, and interest rates. These factors are used to assess expected credit losses (ECLs).\n\n4. **Economic Outlook**: The base forecast anticipates a near-term deceleration in economic growth and a modest increase in unemployment rates, influenced by restrictive monetary policy and elevated household debt levels in Canada.\n\nOverall, the report underscores the bank's cautious approach to credit risk management amid economic uncertainties."

Changes in these inputs, as sumptions, models, and judgments would affect the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of ECLs. he following table presents the base ECL scenario compared to the probability-weighted ECLs, with the latter derived from three ECL scenarios for performing loan s and off-balance sheet instruments. The difference reflects the impact of deriving multiple scenarios around the base ECLs and resultant change in ECLs due t o non-linearity and sensitivity to using macroeconomic forecasts.

As such, the Bank accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The Bank’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. The Bank takes into account changes in the one-month lag period that would significantly affect the results. As at January 31, 2024, the Bank’s reported investment in Schwab was approximately 12.3% (October 31, 2023 – 12.4%), consisting of 9.8% of the outstanding v oting common shares and the remainder in non-voting common shares of Schwab with an aggregate fair value of $19 billion (US$14 billion) (October 31, 2023 – $16 billion (US$12 billion)) based on the closing price of US$62.92 (October 31, 2023 – US$52.04) on the New York Stock Exchange. he Bank and Schwab are party to a stockholder agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”) under which the Bank has the right to designate two members of Schwab’s Board of Directors and has representation on two Board Committees, subject to the Bank meeting certain conditions. The Bank’s designated directors c urrently are the Bank’s Group President and Chief Executive Officer and the Bank’s Chair of the Board. Under the Stockholder Agreement, the Bank is not per mitted to own more than 9.9% voting common shares of Schwab, and the Bank is subject to customary standstill restrictions and subject to certain exceptions, t ransfer restrictions. The carrying value of the Bank’s investment in Schwab of $9.5 billion as at January 31, 2024 (October 31, 2023 – $8.9 billion) represents the Bank’s share of Schwab’s stockholders’ equity, adjusted for goodwill, other intangibles, and cumulative translation adjustment. The Bank’s share of net income from its investment in Schwab of $141 million during the three months ended January 31, 2024 (January 31, 2023 – $285 million) reflects net income after adjustments for am ortization of certain intangibles net of tax.

Under the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject t o certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep depo sit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into an amended insured deposit account agreement (the “2023 Schwab IDA Agreement” or the “Schwab IDA greement”), which replaced the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement. Pursuant to the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank continues to make sweep deposit ac counts available to clients of Schwab. Schwab designates a portion of the deposits with the Bank as fixed-rate obligation amounts (FROA). Remaining deposits over the minimum level of FROA are designated as floating-rate obligations. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement ex tends the initial expiration date by three years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the lat er years. Specifically, until September 2025, the aggregate FROA will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to $6.8 billion (US$5 billion) of FROA by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject t o certain limits. Refer to Note 27 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the Schwab IDA Agreement. uring the first quarter of 2024, Schwab exercised its option to buy down the remaining $0.7 billion (US$0.5 billion) of the US$5 billion FROA buydown allo wance and paid $32 million (US$23 million) in termination fees to the Bank in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement.

However, there was a gain of $800 million from the return on plan assets less interest income.\n\n2. **International Tax Reform**: The Bank is assessing its exposure to the OECD's Pillar Two global minimum tax, which mandates a 15% minimum tax for large multinational enterprises. This legislation could affect the Bank starting in the fiscal year beginning November 1, 2024.\n\n3. **Tax Reassessments**: The Bank is facing reassessments from Canadian tax authorities totaling $1,783 million for the years 2011 to 2018.

(a) RESTRUCTURING The Bank continued to undertake certain measures in the first quarter of 2024 to reduce its cost base and achieve greater efficiency. In connection with these measures, the Bank incurred $291 million of restructuring charges. The restructuring costs primarily relate to: (i) employee severance and other personnel-related costs recorded as provisions and (ii) real estate optimization mainly recorded as a reduction to land and buildings. (b) LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS Other than as described below, there have been no new significant legal and regulatory matters, and no significant developments to the matters previously identified in Note 26 of the Bank’s 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, including but not limited to civil claims and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits, and requests for information by governmental, regulatory and self-regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions, in respect of our businesses and compliance programs. The Bank establishes provisions when it becomes probable that the Bank will incur a loss and the amount can be reliably estimated. The Bank also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) in its legal and regulatory actions (that is, those which are neither probable nor remote), in excess of provisions. As at January 31, 2024, the Bank’s RPL is from zero to approximately $1.42 billion (October 31, 2023 – from zero to approximately $1.44 billion). The Bank’s provisions and RPL represent the Bank’s best estimates based upon currently available information for actions for which estimates can be made, but there are a number of factors that could cause the Bank’s provisions and/or RPL to be significantly different from its actual or RPL. For example, the Bank’s estimates involve significant judgment due to the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants in many proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, some of which are beyond the Bank’s control and/or involve novel legal theories and interpretations, the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. In addition, some actions seek very large or indeterminate damages. The Bank and certain of its subsidiaries have been responding to inquiries from, and cooperating with, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) concerning compliance with records preservation requirements relating to business communications exchanged on unapproved electronic channels. The Bank is engaged in settlement discussions with the SEC and CFTC and anticipates that resolution will include penalties. The SEC and CFTC have conducted similar investigations at other financial institutions. In management’s opinion, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the ultimate disposition of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or the consolidated cash flows of the Bank. However, because of the factors listed above, as well as other uncertainties inherent in litigation and regulatory matters, there is a possibility that the ultimate resolution of legal or regulatory actions may be material to the Bank’s consolidated results of operations for any particular reporting period.",

The bank is involved in various legal and regulatory matters, including ongoing investigations by the SEC and CFTC regarding compliance with records preservation requirements. The bank is in settlement discussions with these agencies and expects to incur penalties. The estimated range of reasonably possible losses from legal actions is between zero and approximately $1.42 billion. Despite these issues, management believes that the outcomes will not materially affect the bank's consolidated financial condition or cash flows, although they could impact results for specific reporting periods due to inherent uncertainties in litigation and regulatory matters."
