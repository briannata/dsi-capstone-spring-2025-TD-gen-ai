In addition, representatives of the Bank may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. All such statements are made pursuant to the “safe harbour” provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management’s Discussion and An alysis (“2022 MD&A”) in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report under the heading “Economic Summary and Outlook”, under the headings “Key Priorities for 2023” and “Operating Environment and Outlook” for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading “2022 Accomplishments and Focus for 2023” for the Corporate segment, and in other statements regarding the Bank’s objectives and priorities for 2023 and beyond and strategies to achieve them, the regulatory environment in which the Bank op erates, and the Bank’s anticipated financial performance. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “will”, “would”, “should”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “estimate”, “plan”, “goal”, “target”, “may”, and “could”. By their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties – many of which are beyond the Bank’s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict – may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, and infrastructure), model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors include general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates; geopolitical risk; inflation, rising rates and recession; the economic, financial, and other impacts of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; the ability of the Bank to execute on long-term strategies and shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion and integration of acquisitions and dispositions, business retention plans, and strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks, data security breaches or technology failures) on the Bank’s information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; model risk; fraud activity; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the Bank’s use of third-party service providers; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations, including without limitation tax laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; exposure related to significant litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes to the Bank’s credit ratings; changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition risk; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Bank; existing and potential international debt crises; environmental and social risk (including climate change); and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events. The Bank cautions that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Bank’s results. For more detailed information, please refer to the “Risk Factors and Management” section of the 2022 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as applicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the heading “Significant Acquisitions”, “Significant and Subsequent Events, and Pending Acquisitions”, “Significant and Subsequent Events” or “Significant Events” in the relevant MD&A, which applicable releases may be found on www.td.com .

        "chunk": "TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 6 a) Acquisition of Cowen Inc. On M arch 1, 2023, t he Bank completed the acquisition of Cowen Inc. (“Cowen”). The acquisition advances the Wholesale Banking segment’s long-term growth strategy in the U.S. and adds complementary products and services to the Bank’s existing businesses. The results of the acquired business have been consolidated by t he Bank from the closing date and primarily reported in the Wholesale Banking segment. Consideration included $1,500 million (US$1,100 million) in cash for 100% of Cowen’s common shares outstanding, $253 million (US$186 million) for the settlement of Cowen’s Series A Preferred Stock, and $205 million (US$151 million) related to t he replacement of shar e-based payment awards. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method. The purchase price allocation can be adjusted during the measurement period, which shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances. The acquisition contributed $10,800 million (US$7,933 million) of assets and $9,884 million (US$7,261 million) of liabilities. The excess of account ing consideration over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired is all ocated to other i ntangible assets of $298 million (US$219 million) net of taxes, and goodwill of $ 744 million (US$546 million). b) Termination of the Merger Agreement with First Horizon Corporation On M ay 4, 2023, the Bank and First H orizon Corporation (“First Horizon”) announced their mutual decision to terminate the previously announced merger a greement for the Bank to acquire First Horizon. Under the terms of t he termination agreement, the Bank made a $306 million (US$225 million) cash payment to irst Horizon on May 5, 2023. The termination payment is r ecognized in non-interest expenses in the current quarter and is reported in the Corporate segment. In connection with the transaction, the Bank had invested US$494 million in non-voti ng First Horizon preferred stock. During the prior quarter, the Bank recognized a valuation adjustment loss of $199 million (US$147 million) on thi s investment, recorded in other comprehensive income. On June 26, 2023, in accordance with the terms of the preferred share purchase agreement, the preferred stock converted into approximately 19.7 million common shares of First Horizon, resulting in the Bank recognizing a loss of $166 million (US$126 million) in other comprehensive income based on First Horizon’s common share price at the time of conversion. The Bank had also implemented a strategy to mitigate the impact of int erest rate volatility to capital on closing of the acquisition. The Bank determined that the fair value of Fi rst Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets would have been sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value of net assets would have determined the amount of goodwill to be recognized on cl osing of the acqui sition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles would have n egatively impacted cap i tal ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fai r value hedge accounting relationships. As a result of the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on t hese swaps were recognized in ear nings, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) would have mitigated the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acquisition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net int erest income over the remaining expected life of the investments. Prior to t he termination of the merger agreement on M ay 4, 2023, for the t hree months and nine months ended July 31, 2023, the Bank reported ($125) million and ($1,386) million, respectively, in non-interest income related to the mark-to- m arket on the sw aps, and $11 million and $262 million, respectively, in net interest income related to t he basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the three months and nine months ended July 31, 2023, the Bank reported $23 million and $585 million, respectively, in non-interest income related to t he net interest earned on the swaps. Following the announcement to terminate the merger agreement, the Bank discontinued this strategy and reinstated hedge accounting on the portfolio of fixe d income investments using new swaps entered into at higher market rates. Income recognized from this strategy will reverse over time causing a decrease to net interest income. During the period, the decrease to net interest income was $63 million recorded in the Corporate segment. The Bank had also implemented a strategy to mitigate FX risk on the expected USD cash consideration. Following the announcement to terminate the merger a greement, the Bank discontinued this strategy. Given the appreciation of t he U.S. dollar during the life of the strategy, the Bank was in a net gain position on the date of hedge termination and cumulative net gains were recognized in accum ulated other comprehensive income. c) I mplementation of the Canada Recovery Dividend and Change in Corporate Tax Rate On D ecember 15, 2022, Bill C-32, Fall Economic Statement Implementation Act, 2022, received Royal Assent. This bill enacted the Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD) and increased the Canadian federal tax rate for bank and life insurer groups by 1. 5%. The implementation of the CRD resulted in a pr ovision for income taxes of $553 million and a charge to other comprehensive income of $239 million, recognized in the fi rst quarter of 2023. The increase in the Canadian federal tax rate of 1.5%, prorated f or the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, resul ted in a provision for income taxes of $82 million and a tax benefit of $75 m illion in ot her comprehensive income related to f iscal 2022, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank also remeasured certain Canadian deferred tax assets and liabilities for the increase in tax rate, which resulted in an increase in net deferred tax assets of $50 million, which is recorded in pr ovision for income taxes. d) Stanford Litigation Settlement In the US Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. action, on February 24, 2023, the Bank reached a settlement in principle (the “settlement” or “agreement”) relating to litigation involving the Stanford Financial Group (the “Stanford litigation”), pursuant to w hich the Bank will pay US$1.205 billion to the court-appointed receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate. Under the terms of the agreement, TD has settled with the receiver, the Official Stanford Investors Committee, and other plaintiffs in the litigation and these parties have agreed to release and dismiss all current or future claims arising from or related to t he Stanford matter. As a result of this agreement, the Bank recorded a provision of appr oximately $1.6 billion pre-tax ($1.2 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank recognized a foreign exchange loss of $39 million ($28 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2023, r eflecting the impact of the difference between the foreign exchange rate used for recording the provision (effective January 31, 2023) and the foreign exchange rate at the t ime the settlement was reached.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights several key financial activities:\n\n1. **Acquisition of Cowen Inc.:** On March 1, 2023, TD Bank completed the acquisition of Cowen Inc. for $1.5 billion in cash, enhancing its Wholesale Banking segment in the U.S. The acquisition added $10.8 billion in assets and $9.9 billion in liabilities, with $298 million allocated to intangible assets and $744 million to goodwill.\n\n2. **Termination of First Horizon Merger:** On May 4, 2023, TD Bank and First Horizon Corporation mutually terminated their merger agreement. TD Bank paid a $306 million termination fee and recognized related financial impacts, including a $166 million loss from the conversion of preferred stock to common shares and adjustments to interest rate swap strategies.\n\n3. **Canada Recovery Dividend and Tax Rate Change:** The implementation of the Canada Recovery Dividend and a 1.5% increase in the Canadian federal tax rate resulted in a $553 million tax provision and a $239 million charge to other comprehensive income in Q1 2023. The tax rate change also led to a $50 million increase in net deferred tax assets.\n\n4. **Stanford Litigation Settlement:** TD Bank settled litigation related to the Stanford Financial Group for US$1.205 billion, resulting in a $1.6 billion pre-tax provision in Q1 2023. A foreign exchange loss of $39 million was recorded in Q2 2023 due to currency rate differences at the time of settlement."

TD is the sixth largest bank in North America by assets and serves more than 27.5 million customers in four key businesses operating in a number of locations in financial centres around the globe: Canadian ersonal and Commercial Banking, including TD Canada Trust and TD Auto Finance Canada; U.S. Retail, including TD Bank, America’s Most Convenient Bank®, TD Auto Finance U.S., TD Wealth (U.S.), and an investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation; Wealth Management and Insurance, including TD Wealth (Canada), TD Direct Investing, and TD Insurance; and Wholesale Banking, including TD Securities and TD Cowen. TD also ranks among the world’s leading o nline financial services firms, with more than 16 million active online and mobile customers. TD had $1.9 trillion in assets on July 31, 2023. The Toronto-Dominion Bank trades under the symbol “TD” on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges. Th e Bank prepares its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS and r efers to results prepared in accordance with IFRS as “reported” results. Non- GAAP and Ot her Financial Measures In addition to reported results, the Bank also presents certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures that are historical, non-GAAP ratios, supplementary financial measures and capital management measures, to assess its results. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as “ adjusted” results, are utilized to assess the Bank’s businesses and to measure the Bank’s overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note” fr om reported results. Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP ratios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings per s hare (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the Bank’s performance. Non-GAAP financial measures and non- GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers. Supplementary financial measures depict the Bank’s financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the Bank’s capital position, and b oth are explained in this document where they first appear. U.S. Strategic Cards The Bank’s U.S. strategic cards portfolio is comprised of agreements with certain U.S. retailers pursuant to which TD is the U.S. issuer of private label and co branded consumer credit cards to their U.S. customers. Under the terms of the individual agreements, the Bank and the retailers share in the profits generated by the relevant portfolios after credit losses. Under IFRS, TD is required to present the gross amount of revenue and provisions for credit losses (PCL) related to these portfolios in the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Statement of Income. At the segment level, the retailer program partners’ share of revenues and cr edit losses is presented in the Corporate segment, with an offsetting amount (representing the partners’ net share) recorded in Non-interest expenses, resulting in no impact to Corporate’s reported Net income (loss). The Net income (loss) included in the U.S. Retail segment includes only the portion of revenue and credit losses attributable to TD under the agreements. Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation and IDA Agreement On October 6, 2020, the Bank acquired an approximately 13.5% stake in The Charles Schwab Corporation (“Schwab”) following the completion of Schwab’s acquisition of TD Am eritrade Holding Corporation (“TD Ameritrade”) of which the Bank was a major shareholder (the “Schwab transaction”). On August 1, 2022, the Bank sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Schwab, which reduced the Bank’s ownership interest in Schwab to approximately 12.0%. The Bank accounts for its i nvestment in Schwab using the equity method. The U.S. Retail segment reflects the B ank’s share of net income from its investment in Schwab. The Corporate segment net income (loss) includes amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the chwab transaction. The Bank’s share of Schwab’s earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. For further details, refer to Note 7 of the Bank’s third quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. On N ovember 25, 2019, the Bank and Schwab signed an insured deposit account agreement (“2019 Schwab IDA Agreement”), with an initial expiration date of Ju ly 1, 2031. Pur suant to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank made sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Starting July 1, 2021, Schwab had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Sc hwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. Refer to the “Related Party Transactions” section in t he 2022 MD&A for further details. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into an amended insured deposit account agreement (the “2023 Schwab IDA Agreement”), which replaced the 2 019 Schwab IDA Agreement. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by three years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until September 2025, the aggregate amount of fixed rate obligations will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to US$5 billion of fixed rate obligations by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to certain limits. During the third quarter of 2023, Schwab exercised its option to buy down $3.3 billion (US$2.4 billion) of fixed rate obligations and paid $151 million (US$112 million) in termination fees to the Bank in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, which is intended to compensate the Bank for losses incurred this quarter from discontinuing certain hedging relationships, and l ost revenues. The net i mpact is recorded in net interest income.",

The bank uses both IFRS-reported and non-GAAP financial measures to assess performance, with non-GAAP measures providing insights into underlying business performance. TD's U.S. strategic cards portfolio involves partnerships with U.S. retailers, sharing profits after credit losses. The bank holds a 12% stake in The Charles Schwab Corporation, reflecting its share of Schwab's net income in its U.S. Retail segment. An amended insured deposit account agreement with Schwab extends the expiration date to 2034, with adjusted deposit balance terms. In Q3 2023, Schwab exercised an option to reduce fixed rate obligations, paying TD $151 million in termination fees, impacting net interest income."

The consolidated Bank adjusted ROE is calculated as adjusted net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. Adjusted ROE is a non- GAAP financial ratio and can be utilized in assessing the Bank’s use of equi ty. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Capital allocated to the business segments was increased to 11% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital effective the first quarter of 2023, compared with 10.5% in fiscal 2022.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 financial report highlights several key insights:\n\n1. **Revenue and Income**: The bank reported an increase in total revenue for both the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022. Net interest income and non-interest income both saw growth, contributing to higher total revenue.\n\n2. **Credit Losses and Expenses**: There was a significant increase in the provision for credit losses, insurance claims, and non-interest expenses compared to the previous year. This reflects a more challenging credit environment and higher operational costs.\n\n3. **Net Income**: Reported net income for the three months ended July 31, 2023, was slightly lower than the previous quarter but higher than the same period in 2022. However, for the nine months ended July 31, 2023, net income was lower compared to 2022.\n\n4. **Adjusted Results**: Adjusted net income, which excludes certain items of note, was higher than reported net income, indicating the impact of specific charges and adjustments. Adjusted earnings per share were also higher than reported figures.\n\n5. **Return on Equity**: The bank's return on common equity (ROE) and return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) were lower on a reported basis compared to the previous year, but adjusted figures showed a more favorable performance.\n\n6. **Significant Adjustments**: The report includes several adjustments for items of note, such as amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction, and costs associated with the terminated First Horizon transaction.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group's financial performance in Q3 2023 shows revenue growth but also highlights increased expenses and credit provisions, impacting net income and returns on equity. Adjusted results provide a more positive view of the bank's underlying performance."

Adjusted net income decreased by 2%.\n\n3. **Net Interest Income**: Increased by 3% year-over-year to $7,289 million, driven by margin growth in personal and commercial banking and foreign exchange impacts, despite a decrease in Wholesale Banking.\n\n4. **Non-Interest Income**: Rose by 41% to $5,490 million, mainly due to higher trading-related revenues in Wholesale Banking and reduced losses from interest rate volatility mitigation.\n\n5. **Provision for Credit Losses (PCL)**: Increased significantly by $415 million year-over-year to $766 million, reflecting normalization in consumer lending and credit migration in commercial lending.\n\n6. **Year-to-Date Performance**: Reported net income decreased by 27% to $7,896 million, while adjusted net income increased by 2% to $11,638 million, with notable segmental variations.\n\n7. **Shareholder Returns**: Total shareholder return for the twelve months ended July 31, 2023, was 9.4%, outperforming the Canadian peer average of -1.2%.\n\nOverall, the report indicates challenges from increased expenses and credit provisions, offset by revenue growth in certain segments and favorable foreign exchange impacts."

Quarterly comparison – Q3 2023 vs. Q2 2023 Insurance claims and related expenses for the quarter increased $119 million, or 15%, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting more severe weather-related events, increased driving activity and claims severity, partially offset by the impact of changes in the discount rate which resulted in a similar decrease in fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non- int erest income. Year-to-date comparison – Q3 2023 vs. Q3 2022 Insurance claims and related expenses were $2,703 million, an increase of $526 million, or 24%, compared with the same period last year, reflecting the impact of cha nges in the discount rate which resulted in a similar increase in the fair value of investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income, more severe weather-related events, increased driving activity and claims severity. Non-Interest Expenses and Efficiency Ratio Quarterly comparison – Q3 2023 vs. Q3 2022 Reported non-interest expenses were $7,582 million, an increase of $1,486 million, or 24%, compared with the third quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher employee-related expenses, the payment related to the termination of the First Horizon transaction, higher acquisition and integration-related charges, including winddown costs of t he terminated First Horizon transaction, and higher spend supporting business growth. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses were $6,953 million, an increase of $920 million, or 15%. By s egment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects increases in Wholesale Banking of $556 million, in the Corporate segment of $533 million, in U.S. Retail of $289 million, in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $88 million, and in Wealth Management and Insurance of $20 million. The Bank’s reported efficiency ratio was 59.3%, compared to 55.8% in the third quarter last year. The Bank’s adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.4%, compared with 52.0% in the third quarter last year. Quarterly comparison – Q3 2023 vs. Q2 2023 Reported non-interest expenses increased $595 million, or 9%, compared with the prior quarter, primarily reflecting the payment related to the termination of the First Horizon transaction. Adjusted non-interest expenses increased $260 million, or 4%, compared with the prior quarter, primarily reflecting a litigation settlement du ring the quarter, higher employee-related expenses, and higher spend supporting business growth. By segment, the increase in reported non-interest expenses reflects increases in the Corporate segment of $587 million, in Wholesale Banking of $58 million, and in W ealth Management and Insurance of $4 million, partially offset by decreases in U.S. Retail of $46 million and in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking of $8 million. The Bank’s reported efficiency ratio was 59.3%, compared with 56.5% in the prior quarter. The Bank’s adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.4%, compared with 5 3.4% in the prior quarter. Year-to-date comparison – Q3 2023 vs. Q3 2022 Reported non-interest expenses of $22,885 million increased $4,789 million, or 26%, compared with the same period last year, primarily reflecting the Stanford litigation settlement, higher employee-related expenses, higher acquisition and integration-related charges, including winddown costs of the t erminated First Horizon transaction, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. On an adjusted basis, non-interest expenses were $20,187 million, an increase of $2,258 million, or 13%.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Provision for Credit Losses (PCL):** Year-to-date PCL increased significantly to $2,055 million, up by $1,605 million from the previous year. This rise is attributed to normalization of credit performance, with impaired PCL at $1,767 million and performing PCL at $288 million. The increase was mainly in Canadian consumer lending portfolios, reflecting credit conditions and volume growth. PCL was notably higher in Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Corporate, and Wholesale Banking segments.\n\n2. **Insurance Claims and Expenses:** Insurance claims and related expenses rose by 24% year-to-date to $2,703 million, driven by severe weather events, increased driving activity, and claims severity. Quarterly, these expenses increased by 11% compared to Q3 2022 and by 15% compared to Q2 2023.\n\n3. **Non-Interest Expenses:** Reported non-interest expenses increased by 24% year-over-year to $7,582 million, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, costs related to the termination of the First Horizon transaction, and business growth support. Adjusted non-interest expenses rose by 15%. The reported efficiency ratio increased to 59.3% from 55.8% in the previous year, while the adjusted efficiency ratio was 53.4%, up from 52.0%.\n\nOverall, the report indicates increased provisions for credit losses, higher insurance claims due to external factors, and rising non-interest expenses driven by strategic and operational changes."

The Bank’s reported efficiency ratio was 61.2%, compared with 54.1% in the same period last year. The Bank’s adjusted efficiency ratio was 52.2%, compared with 52.9% in the same period last year. Income Taxes The Bank’s effective income tax rate on a r eported basis was 20.7% for the current quarter, compared with 19.3% in t he third quarter last year and 21.8% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the impact of the termination of the First Horizon merger agreement, higher favourable tax adjustments in the prior year and an increase in the Canadian income tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix and the current quarter recognition of historical tax losses at a higher Canadian tax rate. The quarter-over-quarter decrease primarily reflects lower pre-tax income, business mix, the current quarter recognition of historical tax losses at a higher Canadian tax rate and favourable tax adjustments, partially offset by the impact of the termination of the First Horizon merger agreement. To allow for an after-tax calculation of adjusted income, the adjusted provision for income taxes is calculated by adjusting the taxes for each item of note using the statutory income tax rate of the applicable legal entity. The adjusted effective income tax rate is calcul ated as the adjusted provision for income taxes as a percentage of adjusted net income before taxes. The Bank’s adjusted effective income tax rate was 19.9% for the current quarter, compared with 20.3% in the third quarter last year and 21.9% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects the impact of business mix and the current quarter recognition of historical tax losses at a higher Canadian tax rate, partially offset by higher favourable tax adjustments in the prior year and the increase in the Canadian income ta x rate. The quarter-over-quarter decrease primarily reflects lower pre-tax income, business mix, the current quarter recognition of historical tax losses at a higher Canadian tax rate and favourable tax adjustments.

Budgetary Tax Measures The Canadian Federal budget presented on March 28, 2023 (“the Budget”) proposed to int roduce tax measures that could impact the Bank. On June 22, 2023, Bill C-47, Budget Implementation Act, 2023, No. 1, received Royal Assent. This bill enacted one of the proposed tax measures by amending the definition of a “financial service” such that payment card clearing services rendered by a payment card network operator are subject to GST/HST. The legislation was retrospective and resulted in a charge to non-interest income of $57 million, recognized in the third quarter of 2023. On August 4, 2023, draft legislative proposals were released for public comment relating to other Budget measures, including a 2% tax on the net value of share repurchases by public corporations in Canada and draft legislative proposals relating to the implementation of a global minimum tax initiated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Pillar Two). The proposal is that the Pillar Two rules will take effect for fiscal years that begin on or after December 31, 2023, which will be November 1, 2024 for the Bank. We expect additional draft legislative proposals to be issued shortly that will deny financial institutions a deduction in respect of dividends received on certain shares of other corporations resident in Canada. The Bank is participating actively in the public comment process on these and other tax proposals that may impact the Bank and the broader Canadian economy.",
        "summary": "The ANK Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights an increase in non-interest expenses across various segments, with the Corporate segment seeing the largest rise. The reported efficiency ratio increased to 61.2% from 54.1% the previous year, while the adjusted efficiency ratio slightly improved to 52.2% from 52.9%. The effective income tax rate rose to 20.7% from 19.3% year-over-year, influenced by the termination of the First Horizon merger agreement, tax adjustments, and changes in the Canadian tax rate. The adjusted effective tax rate decreased to 19.9% from 20.3% due to business mix and recognition of historical tax losses. The Canadian Federal budget introduced tax measures affecting the Bank, including a GST/HST charge on payment card services and a proposed 2% tax on share repurchases. The Bank is engaging in the public comment process on these proposals."

        "chunk": "- TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 15 The global economy remains on track to slow in calendar 2023, but to a l esser extent than anticipated in the previous quarter. As a result, inflation rates across the G-7 have stayed elevated, and central banks have raised interest rates further. The lagged impact of cumulative interest rate hikes is expected to be the primary in fluence dampening economic growth and returning inflation closer to the target ranges of the various regions by the end of 2024. The impact of bank failures in the U.S. earlier this year has had a more modest impact than initially anticipated. The U.S. economy expanded by 2.4% annualized in the second calendar quarter of 2023. Underlying domestic demand grew at a heal thy 2.3% pace, as business investment accelerated after a soft performance in the first calendar quarter. Consumer spending slowed, while real income growth improved alongside lo wer inflation. Housing activity continued to weigh on economic growth, as a modest improvement in new home construction was not enough to outweigh weakness in t he resale market. As of July, the U.S. job market was still tight with the unemployment rate at 3.5% in July, close to its multi-decade low. However, there are signs that demand for workers is cooling, as evidenced by both slower trend growth in payrolls and gradually declining job openings. Helped by lower gasoline prices, inflation metrics have been moderating in recent months. Underlying services prices, which have been a source of persistent price pressure, have also started to cool. Nonetheless, inflation remains well above the U.S. Federal Reserve’s 2% target and the central bank remains highly attentive to upsi de inflation risks. Economics expects the federal funds rate will remain at its current range of 5.25-5.50% through the end of calendar 2023. However, the economic e nvironment remains fluid. The central bank could embark on additional interest rate hikes if a further cooling in the labour market and inflation do not materialize in line with its expectations. Given the steep rise in interest rates over the past year, the trend towards tighter U.S. credit conditions and the likelihood of rolling periods of financial stress related to risk factors, the probability of a recession stateside remains elevated. The Canadian economy recorded a solid 3.1% annualized rate of expansion in the first calendar quarter of 2023, reflecting a rebound from a soft showing registered in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022. Despite the financial impact of rising interest costs on highly indebted households, consumer spending was strong, supported by population growth, strong job market conditions, excess savings and increased government supports. The housing sector remained a drag on economic growth in the first calendar quarter but has since shown signs of stabilization. Canadian inflation has moderated, although progress on core inflation metrics has been slow. The trend rate of job growth has slowed below that of the labour force, pushing the unemployment rate higher. TD Economics expects the unemployment rate to continue to move higher in the months ahead. That is expected to c ontribute to a downturn in consumer spending through the first half of 2024. Given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of substantial interest rate hikes on highly indebted Canadian households, the risk of recession also remains elevated in Canada. The Bank of Canada raised the overnight interest rate in July to 5. 00%, and expressed concern about the persistence of underlying inflation. The incoming economic data will determine whether more interest rate hikes will be required in Canada to bring inflation down to the 2% target. The Canadian dollar is expected to hover around the 75 U.S. cent mark in calendar 2023. For management reporting purposes, the Bank’s business operations and activities are organized around the following four key business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The Bank’s other activities are grouped into the Corporate segment. Results of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the Bank measures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments, the Bank indicates that the measure is adj usted. For further details, refer to the “How We Performed” section of this document, the “Business Focus” section in the Bank’s 2022 MD&A, and Note 29 of the Bank’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2022. PCL related to performing (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and impaired (Stage 3) financial assets, loan commitments, and financial guarantees is recorded within the respective segment. Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt income, including certain dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent pre-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking results is reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the quarter was $40 million, compared with $40 million in the prior quarter and $41 million in the third quarter last year. Share of net income from investment in Schwab is reported in the U.S. Retail segment. Amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the Schwab transaction are recorded in the Corporate segment.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's Third Quarter 2023 report highlights several key economic and financial insights:\n\n1. **Global Economic Outlook**: The global economy is expected to slow in 2023, but less than previously anticipated. Inflation remains high across the G-7, prompting further interest rate hikes by central banks. The cumulative impact of these hikes is expected to slow economic growth and bring inflation closer to target ranges by the end of 2024.\n\n2. **U.S. Economic Conditions**: The U.S. economy grew by 2.4% in the second quarter of 2023, with strong business investment and improved real income growth. However, consumer spending slowed, and the housing market remains a drag on growth. The job market is tight, but signs of cooling are evident. Inflation is moderating but remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, with the federal funds rate expected to stay at 5.25-5.50% through 2023. The risk of a U.S. recession remains elevated due to tighter credit conditions and potential financial stress.\n\n3. **Canadian Economic Conditions**: Canada saw a 3.1% growth rate in the first quarter of 2023, driven by strong consumer spending despite rising interest costs. The housing sector is stabilizing, but job growth is slowing, leading to higher unemployment. The risk of recession is also elevated in Canada, with the Bank of Canada raising interest rates to combat persistent inflation.\n\n4. **TD Bank's Financial Performance**: The bank's operations are divided into four segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The report details financial metrics such as net interest income, credit loss provisions, and net income for these segments. The Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segment reported increased net interest income and total revenue, with a return on common equity of 35.4% for the quarter.\n\n5. **Operational Metrics**: The bank maintains 1,060 Canadian retail branches and employs an average of 29,172 full-time equivalent staff. The capital allocated to the business segment increased to 11% CET1 Capital in fiscal 2023.\n\nOverall, the report underscores the challenges posed by high inflation and interest rates, the potential for economic slowdowns in the U.S. and Canada, and TD Bank's financial performance amidst these conditions."

For the U.S. Retail segment, this calculation excludes the impact related to sweep deposits arrangeme nts and interco mpany deposits and cash collateral. The value of tax-exempt int erest income is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. For investment securities, the adju stment to fair value is included in the calculation of average interest-earning assets. Management believes this calculation better reflects segment performance. Net interest income and a verage interest-earning assets used in the calculation are non-GAAP financial measures. 8 For additional information about this metric, refer to the Glossary of this document.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking**: Net income decreased by 1% year-over-year to $1,655 million, primarily due to higher provisions for credit losses (PCL) and non-interest expenses, despite a 7% revenue increase. The annualized return on equity (ROE) dropped to 35.4% from 42.3% last year. Loan and deposit volumes grew, but net interest margin improvements were offset by higher PCL.\n\n2. **U.S. Retail**: Reported net income decreased by 9% year-over-year to $1,314 million, with adjusted net income down 6%. The decline was driven by higher non-interest expenses and PCL, despite a 10% revenue increase. The net interest margin improved due to higher deposit margins, but deposit volumes fell. The efficiency ratio worsened slightly.\n\n3. **Wealth Management and Insurance**: Net income fell by 12% to $504 million, impacted by higher insurance claims due to severe weather and increased driving activity. Revenue was relatively flat, with a slight increase in non-interest income. Assets under administration and management grew due to market appreciation.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group faced challenges with increased credit losses and expenses, impacting net income across segments, despite revenue growth and improved interest margins."

Quarterly comparison – Q3 2023 vs. Q3 2022 Wholesale Banking reported net income for the quarter was $272 million, relatively flat compared with the third quarter last year, reflecting higher non-interest expenses largely offset by higher revenues. On an adjusted basis, net income was $377 million, an increase of $106 million or 39%. Revenue for the quarter, including TD Cowen, was $1,568 million, an increase of $492 million, or 46%, compared with the third quarter last year. Higher revenue primarily reflects higher equity commissions, underwriting fees, trading-related revenue, global transaction banking revenue, and markdowns in certain loan underwriting commitments in the prior year. PCL for the quarter was $25 million, flat compared with the third quarter last year. PCL – impaired was $10 million, an increase of $10 million. PCL – performing was $15 million, a decrease of $10 million. Reported non-interest expenses for the quarter, including TD Cowen, were $1,247 million, an increase of $556 million, or 80%, compared with the third quarter last year, primarily reflecting acquisition and integration-related costs. Higher expenses also reflected continued investments in Wholesale Banking’s U.S. dollar strategy, including the hiring of banking, sales and trading, and technology professionals, and the impact of foreign exchange translation.

On an adjusted basis, net income was $377 million, an i ncrease of $164 million, or 77%. Revenue for the quarter, including TD C owen, increased $151 million, or 11% , compared with the prior quarter. Higher revenue primarily reflects higher trading related revenue, underwriting fees, and equity commissions, partially offset by low er advisory fees. PCL increased by $13 million compared with the prior quarter. PCL – impaired increased by $5 million. PCL – performing increased by $8 million. Reported non-interest expenses for the quarter, including TD Cowen, increased $58 m illion, or 5%, compared with the prior quarter, primarily reflecting acquisition and integration-related costs.

On an adjusted basis, net income was $937 million, a decrease of $127 million, or 12% . Revenue for the period, including TD Cowen, was $4,330 million, an increase of $658 million, or 18% , compared with the same period last year. Higher revenue primarily reflects higher global transaction banking revenue, equity commissions, advisory fees, lending revenue, and markdowns in certain loan underwriting commitments in the same period last year, partially offset by lower trading-related revenue. PCL was $69 million, an i ncrease of $58 million compared with the same period last year. PCL – impaired was $16 million, compared with a recovery of $5 million in the same period last year. PCL – performing was $53 million, an increase of $37 million. The current year provisions largely reflect volume growth, updates to our economic forecasts, and credit migration. Reported non-interest expenses, including TD Cowen, were $3,319 million, an i ncrease of $1,088 million, or 49%, compared with the same period last year, primarily reflecting acquisition and integration-related costs.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Wealth Management and Insurance**: \n   - Q3 2023 net income was $504 million, a 10% decrease from Q2 2023, primarily due to higher insurance claims and related expenses.\n   - Revenue increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher volumes in the insurance business and increased fee-based and transaction revenue in wealth management.\n   - Year-to-date net income was $1,617 million, a 14% decrease from the same period in 2022, mainly due to lower earnings in wealth management.\n   - Insurance claims and related expenses rose significantly due to severe weather events and increased driving activity.\n\n2. **Wholesale Banking**:\n   - Q3 2023 reported net income was $272 million, flat compared to Q3 2022, but on an adjusted basis, net income increased by 39% to $377 million.\n   - Revenue for the quarter was $1,568 million, a 46% increase from Q3 2022, driven by higher equity commissions, underwriting fees, and trading-related revenue.\n   - Non-interest expenses increased significantly due to acquisition and integration-related costs, particularly from the TD Cowen acquisition.\n   - Year-to-date net income was $753 million, a 29% decrease from the same period in 2022, despite an 18% increase in revenue, due to higher non-interest expenses.\n\nOverall, the report indicates challenges in managing increased expenses and claims in both segments, despite revenue growth."

Quarterly comparison – Q3 2023 vs. Q3 2022 Corporate segment’s reported net loss for the quarter was $782 million, compared with a reported net loss of $752 million in the third quarter last year. The increase primarily reflects higher net corporate expenses reflecting litigation expenses during the quarter, partially offset by higher revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities. The adjusted net loss for the quarter was $182 million, compared with an adjusted net l oss of $175 million in the third quarter last year. Quarterly comparison – Q3 2023 vs. Q2 2023 Corporate segment’s reported net loss for the quarter was $782 million, compared with a reported net loss of $399 million in the prior quarter. The increase primarily reflects the payment related to the termination of the First Horizon transaction and higher net corporate expenses reflecting litigation expenses during the quarter. Other items increased by $137 million, primarily reflecting higher revenue from treasury and balance sheet management activities. The adjusted net l oss for the quarter was $182 million, compared with an adjusted net loss of $177 million in the prior quarter.

The impact of foreign exchange translation from the appreciation in the Canadian dollar decreased total assets by $30 billion. The decrease in total assets reflects a decrease in cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $57 billion, debt securities at amortized cost (DSAC) of $38 billion, derivative assets of $33 billion, and non-trading financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) of $3 billion. The decrease was partially o ffset by an incr ease in securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements of $41 billion, loans, net of allowances for loan losses of $37 billion, trading lo ans, securities, and other of $15 billion, other assets of $6 bi llion, and investment in Schwab of $1 bi llion. Cash and interest-bearing deposits with banks decreased $57 billion primarily reflecting cash management activities. Trading loans, securities, and other increased $15 billion primarily in equity securities, trading loans and the impact of Cowen acquisition, partially offset by co mmodities held for trading and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Non- tradin g financial assets at fair value through profit or loss decreased $3 billion reflecting maturities and sales. Derivative assets d ecreased $33 bi llion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. Debt securities at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses decreased $38 billion primarily reflecting maturities and sales of government securities, and t he impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by new investments. Se curities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements increased $41 billion primarily reflecting an increase in volume. Loans, net of allowance for loan losses increased $37 bil lion reflecting volume growth in real estate secured lending, and business and government loans, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Investment in Schwab increased $1 billion primarily reflecting the impact of the Bank’s share of Schwab’s net income and other comprehensive gain. Other assets increased $6 billion primarily reflecting an increase in amounts receivable from brokers, dealers and clients due to higher volumes of pending trades, th e acquired held for sale businesses, goodwill and intangibles as a result of the Cowen acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in current income tax receivable, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Total liabilities were $1,774 billion as at July 31, 2023, a decrease of $32 billion from October 31, 2022. The impact of foreign exchange translation from the appreciation in the Canadian dollar decreased total liabilities by $31 billion. The decrease in total liabilities reflects a decrease in deposit of $71 billion and derivatives of $28 billion. The decrease was partially offset by obligations related to se curities sold under repurchase agreements of $36 billion, increase in financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss of $20 billion, other liabilities of $6 bi llion and trading deposits of $5 billion. Trading deposits increased $5 billion primarily reflecting new i ssuances. Derivative liabilities decreased $28 billion primarily reflecting changes in mark-to-market values of foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 25 inancial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss i ncreased $20 billion primarily reflecting new issuances, partially offset by maturities and the impact of forei gn exchange translation. Deposits decreased $71 billion reflecting lower volumes in per sonal and business and government deposits, and the impact of f oreign exchange translation. Obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements increased $36 billion reflecting an incr ease in volume. Other liabilities increased $6 billion primarily reflecting increase in liabilities related to str uctured entities, dividends and interest accrued and increase in provision for the Stanford litigation settlement, partially offset by amounts payable to brokers, dealers, and clients due to l ower volumes of pendi ng trades, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Equity was $113 billion as at July 31, 2023, an increase of $1 billion from October 31, 2022. The increase reflects retained earnings and common shares issued with a 2% discount under the dividend reinvestment plan, partially offset by losses in accumulated other comprehensive income. The decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income is primarily driven by the impact of forei gn currency translation, partially offset by gai ns on cash flow hedges and the Bank’s share of the other comprehensive gain from investment in Schwab. Quarterly comparison – Q3 2023 vs. Q3 2022 Gross impaired loans excluding acquired credit-impaired (ACI) loans were $2,980 million as at July 31, 2023, an increase of $648 million, or 28%, compared with the third quarter last year. Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking gross impaired loans increased $463 million, or 55% , compared with the third quarter last year, reflecting formations outpacing resolutions in the com mercial and consumer lending portfolios. U.S. Retail gross impaired loans increased $105 million, or 7 %, compared with the third quarter last year, reflecting the impact of foreign exchange, and formations outpacing resolutions in the consum er and commercial lending portfolios. Wholesale gross impaired loans increased $79 million, compared with the third quarter last year, largely related to a few for mations across varying industries. Net impaired loans were $1,996 million as at July 31, 2023, an i ncrease of $364 million, or 22% , compared with the third quarter last year. The allowance for credit losses of $7,774 million as at July 31, 2023 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $989 m illion, Stage 2 allowance of $3,696 m illion and Stage 1 allowance of $3,087 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $2 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $282 million, or 40% , reflecting some normalization of credit performance, and the i mpact of foreign exchange. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses increased $575 million, or 9% , reflecting increases across segments, largely related to credit condi tions, the impact of forei gn exchange, and volume growth. The allowance change included an incr ease of $166 million attributable to t he retailer program partners’ share of the U.S. strategic cards portfolio. The allowance for debt securities decreased by $4 million, compared with the third quarter last year. Forward-looking information, including macroeconomic variables deemed to be predictive of expect ed credit losses (ECLs) based on the Bank’s experience, is u sed to determine ECL scenarios and associated probability weights to determine the probability-weighted ECLs. Each quarter, all base forecast macroeconomic variables are refreshed, resulting in new upside and downside macroeconomic scenarios. The probability weightings assigned to each ECL scenario are also reviewed each quarter and updated as required, as part of the Bank’s ECL governance process. As a result of peri odic reviews and quarterly updates, the allowance for credit losses may be revised to reflect updates in loss estimates based on the Bank’s recent loss experience and its forward-looking views. The Bank periodically reviews the methodology and has performed certain additional quantitative and qualitative portfolio and loan level assessments of significant incre ase in credit risk. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s third quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on forward-looking information. The probability-weighted allowance for credit losses reflects the Bank’s forward-looking views. To the extent that certain anticipated effects cannot be fully incorporated into quantitative models, management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in determining the amount of ECLs. The allowance for credit losses will be updated in future quarters as additional information becomes available. Refer to N ote 3 of the Bank’s third quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Bank calculates allowances for ECLs on debt securities measured at am ortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Bank has $370 billion in such debt securi ties, all of w hich are performing (Stage 1 and 2) and none are impaired (Stage 3). The allowance for credit losses on DSAC and d ebt securities at FVOCI was $1 million and $1 million, respectively. Quarterly comparison – Q3 2023 vs. Q2 2023 Gross impaired loans excluding ACI loans increased $321 million, or 12%, compared with the prior quarter. Impaired loans net of all owance increased $193 million, or 11% , compared with the prior quarter. The allowance for credit losses of $7,774 million as at July 31, 2023 was comprised of Stage 3 allowance for impaired loans of $989 m illion, Stage 2 allowance of $3,696 m illion and Stage 1 allowance of $3,087 million, and the allowance for debt securities of $2 million. The Stage 1 and 2 allowances are for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The Stage 3 allowance for loan losses increased $127 million, or 15% , compared with the prior quarter, largely reflecting credit migration in t he commercial and Wholesale lending portfolios, and some further nor malization of credit performance in the Canadian consumer lending portfolios. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for loan losses increased $1 million, compared with the prior quarter, reflecting an increase in the Canadian c onsumer lending portfolios related to some further normalization of credit performance, coupled with an update to the interest rate outlook, and volume growth, primarily offset by t he impact of f oreign exchange. The allowance for debt securities decreased by $1 million, compared to the pr ior quarter. For further details on loans, impaired loans, allowance for credit losses, and on the Bank’s use of forward-looking information and macroeconomic variables in d etermining its allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 6 of the Bank’s third quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Net Income and Losses**: The corporate segment reported a net loss of $782 million for Q3 2023, an increase from $752 million in Q3 2022, primarily due to higher litigation expenses. The adjusted net loss was $182 million, slightly higher than the $175 million loss in Q3 2022.\n\n2. **Year-to-Date Performance**: For the nine months ending July 31, 2023, the reported net loss was $3,798 million, significantly higher than the $1,130 million loss in the same period in 2022. This increase was driven by litigation settlements, tax provisions, and costs related to the termination of the First Horizon transaction.\n\n3. **Revenue and Expenses**: Total revenue for Q3 2023 was $12,779 million, up from $10,925 million in Q3 2022. However, non-interest expenses also rose to $7,582 million from $6,096 million in the previous year, reflecting increased costs.\n\n4. **Balance Sheet Changes**: Total assets decreased by $31 billion from October 2022 to July 2023, primarily due to a reduction in cash and interest-bearing deposits, derivative assets, and debt securities. Liabilities also decreased by $32 billion, mainly due to lower deposits and derivatives.\n\n5. **Credit and Loans**: Gross impaired loans increased by 28% year-over-year to $2,980 million, with net impaired loans rising by 22%. The allowance for credit losses was $7,774 million, reflecting increases in allowances for both performing and impaired loans.\n\n6. **Equity and Returns**: Total equity increased slightly to $113 billion, with a return on common equity of 11.2% reported and 14.1% adjusted for Q3 2023.\n\nOverall, the report indicates challenges due to litigation and transaction-related expenses, alongside growth in revenue and adjustments in asset and liability management."

Real Estate Secured Lending Retail real estate secured lending includes mortgages and l ines of credit to North American consumers to satisfy financing needs including home purchases and refinancing. While the Bank retains first lien on the majority of properties held as security, there is a small portion of loans with second liens, but most of these are behind a TD m ortgage that is in first position. In Canada, credit policies are designed so that t he combined exposure of all uninsured facilities on one property does not exceed 80% of the collateral value at origination. Lending at a higher loan-to-value ratio is permitted by legislation but requires default insurance. This insurance is cont ractual coverage for the life of eligible facilities and protects the Bank’s real estate secured lending portfolio against potential losses caused by borrowers’ default. The Bank may also purchase default insurance on lower loan-to-value ratio loans. The insurance is provided by either government-backed entities or approved private mortgage insurers. In the U.S., for residential mortgage originations, mortgage insurance is usually obtained from either government ba cked entities or approved private mortgage insurers when the loan-to-value exceeds 80% of the collateral value at origination. The Bank regularly performs stress tests on its real estate lending portfolio as part of its overall stress testing program. This is done with a view to determine the ex tent to which the portfolio would be vulnerable to a severe downturn in economic conditions. The effect of severe changes in house prices, interest rates, and unemployment levels are among the factors considered when assessing the impact on credit losses and the Bank’s overall profitability. A variety of portfolio segments, including dwelling type and geographical regions, are examined during the exercise to determine whether specific vulnerabilities exist.

All figures are calculated based on current customer payment amounts, including voluntary payments larger than the original contractual amounts and/or other voluntary prepayments. The most recent customer payment amount may exceed the original contractual amount due. Balances with a remaining amortization longer than 30 years primarily reflect Canadian variable rate mortgages where interest rate increases relative to current customer payment levels have resulted in a longer current amortization period. At renewal, the amortization period for Canadian mortgages reverts to the remaining contractual amortization, which may require increased payments.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights several key financial metrics and trends. The report shows an increase in gross impaired loans, which rose to $2,980 million by the end of July 2023, up from $2,659 million in April 2023 and $2,332 million in July 2022. The allowance for credit losses also increased, reaching $7,774 million, compared to $7,647 million in April 2023 and $6,921 million in July 2022. Net impaired loans as a percentage of net loans slightly increased to 0.22% from 0.21% in April 2023.\n\nIn real estate secured lending, the bank maintains a significant portfolio, with a total of $374,367 million in July 2023, up from $359,552 million in October 2022. The report emphasizes the bank's use of default insurance to mitigate risks in its real estate lending portfolio, particularly for loans with a loan-to-value ratio exceeding 80%. The bank conducts regular stress tests to assess the portfolio's vulnerability to economic downturns.\n\nThe report also provides insights into the geographical distribution of real estate secured lending, with Ontario holding the largest share of uninsured loans. The average loan-to-value ratio for newly originated and acquired loans remains stable, with slight variations across different regions in Canada and the United States. Overall, the report reflects a cautious approach to credit risk management amid changing economic conditions."

Capital requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are commonly referred to as Basel II I. Under Basel III, Total Capital consists of three components, namely CET1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2 Capital. Risk sensitive regulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1, and Total Capital by risk-weighted assets (RWA), inclusive of any minimum requirements outlined under the regulatory floor. In 2015, Basel III introduced a non-risk sensitive le verage ratio to act as a supplementary measure to the risk-sensitive capital requirements. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 Capital by leverage e xposure which is primarily comprised of on-balance sheet assets with adjustments made to derivative and securities financing transaction exposures, and credit eq uivalent amounts of off-balance sheet exposures. TD manages its r egulatory capital in accordance with the Basel III Capital Framework as discussed in the “Capital Position” section of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. OSFI’s C apital Requirements under Basel III OSFI’s Capital Adequacy Requirements guideline details how the Basel III capital rules apply to Canadian banks. Other requirements, in addition to those described in “OSFI’s Capital Requirements under Basel III” section of Bank’s 2022 Annual R eport, are noted below. The Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) level increased to 3% as of February 1, 2023. The 50 bps increase from the previous level of 2.5% reflects OSFI’s assessment that systemic vulnerabilities remain elevated. In addition, OSFI increased the DSB range from 0 to 4%, instead of the previous 0 to 2.5% to allow the DSB to remain responsive to an uncer tain environment. On February 1, 2023, OSFI implemented revised capital rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to make them suitable for domestic implementation. These revised rules include revisions to the calculation of credit risk and operational risk requirements, and revisions to the Leverage Requirements Guideline to include a requirement for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the regulatory minimum requirement of 3.0%. This buffer will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio supervisory target of 6.75%. The table below summarizes OSFI’s curr ent regulatory minimum capital and TLAC ratios for the Bank as at July 31, 2023. Minimum Capital Conservation Buffer D-SIB / G-SIB Surcharge 1 Pillar 1 Regulatory arget 2 DSB Pillar 1 & 2 Regulatory Ta rget CET1 4.5 % 2.5 % 1.0 % 8.0 % 3.0 % 11 .0 % Tier 1 6 .0 2.5 1.0 9.5 3.0 12 .5 Total Capital 8.0 2.5 1.0 11 .5 3.0 14 .5 Leverage 3.0 n/a 0.5 3.5 n/a 3.5 LAC 18.0 2.5 1.0 21 .5 3.0 24 .5 TLAC Leverage 6 .75 n /a 0.50 7 .25 n /a 7.25 1 The higher of the D-SIB and Global Systemically Important Bank (G-S IB) surcharge applies to risk weighted capital. The D-SIB surcharge is currently equivalent to the Bank’s 1% G-SIB addition al common equity requirement for risk weig hted capital. The G-SIB surcharge may increase above 1% if the Bank’s G-SIB score increases above certain thresholds to a maxi mum of 4.5%. OSFI’s Leverage Requirements Guideline includes a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer set at 50% of a D-SIB’s higher loss absorbency risk-weighted requirem ents, effectively 0.50%.

As at Jul y 31, 2023, the Bank’s CET1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 15.2%, 17.2%, and 19.6%, respectively. The decrease in the Bank’s CET1 Capital ratio compared to October 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to RWA growth across various segments (including an increase in RWA as a result of the Cowen acquisition), mark-to-market losses on swaps de-designated from hedge accounting relationships to mitigate the impacts of interest rate volatility to capital for the terminated First Horizon transaction, the Stanford litigation settlement, common shares repurchased for cancellation, and an increase in the goodwill and intangibles deduction related to the Cowen acquisition. CET1 was also impacted by the CRD, foreign exchange hedging of the First Horizon purchase price, and the elimination of the scaling factor related to OSFI’s transition arrangements for ECL provisioning. The impact of the foregoing items was partially offset by organic growth, and the issuance of common shares pursuant to the Bank’s dividend reinvestment plan.",

The decrease in the Bank’s Leverage ratio from 4.9% as at October 31, 2022 was attributable primarily to increased leverage exposures across various segments, largely driven by the expiration of the temporary exclusion of central bank reserves in determining leverage exposure, common shares repurchased for cancellation, and an increase in the goodwill and intangibles deduction related to the Cowen acquisition, partially offset by organic capital growth and the issuance of common shares pursuant to the Bank’s dividend reinvestment plan. Future Regulatory Capital Developments Future regulatory capital developments, in addition to those described in the “Future Regulatory Capital Developments” section of the B ank’ s 2022 Annual Report, are noted below .

On August 23, 2023, the Board approved a dividend in an amount of ninety-six cents (96 cents) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the Bank for the quarter ending October 31, 2023, payable on and after October 31, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 6, 2023. The Bank offers a dividend reinvestment plan for its common shareholders. Participation in the plan is optional and under the terms of the plan, cash dividends on co mmon shares are used to purchase additional common shares. At the option of the Bank, the common shares may be issued from treasury at an average market price based on the last five trading days before the date of the dividend payment, with a discount of between 0% to 5% at the Bank’s discretion or purchased from the open market at market price. During the three months ended July 31, 2023, the Bank issued 2.0 million common shares from treasury with no discount. During the nine months ended July 31, 2023, the Bank issued 2.0 million common shares from treasury with no discount and 16.8 million common shares with a 2% discount.

During the nine months ended July 31, 2022, the Bank issued 2.5 million common shares from treasury with no discount and 7.5 million common shares with a 2% discount. On May 25, 2023, the Bank announced that beginning with the dividend approved on May 24, 2023 for the quarter ending July 31, 2023, there will no longer be a discount to the average market price applied to the issue of common shares from treasury.",

During the three months ended July 31, 2023, the Bank repurchased 14.25 million common s hares under the NCIB, at an average pr ice of $82.85 per share for a total amount of $1.2 billion. On August 24, 2023, the Bank announced that upon the completion of the repurchase for cancellation of 30 million of its common shares under its existing NCIB, it intends to terminate its existing NCIB and, subject to the approval of OSFI and the Toronto Stock Exchange, it intends to launch a new normal course issuer bid to repurchase for cancellation up to 90 million of its common shares. NON-VIABILITY CONTINGENT CAPITAL PROVISION If an NVCC trigger event were to occur, for all series of Class A First Preferred Shares excluding the preferred shares issued with respect to LRCNs, the maximum n umber of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the respective series of preferred shares at the time of conversion, would be 1.1 billion in aggregate. The LRCNs, by virtue of the recourse to the preferred shares held in the Limited Recourse Trust, include NVCC provisions. For LRCNs, if an NVCC trigger were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there are no declared and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares series issued in connection with such LRCNs, would be 1.1 billion in aggregate. For NVCC subordinated notes and debentures, if an NVCC trigger event were to occur, the maximum number of common shares that could be issued, assuming there is no accrued and unpaid interest on the respective subordinated notes and debentures, would be 3.2 billion in aggregate. Growing profitability in financial results based on balanced revenue, expense and capital growth services involves selectively taking and managing risks within the Ba nk’s risk appetite. The Bank’s goal is to earn a stable and sustainable rate of return for every dollar of risk it takes, while putting significant emphasis on investing in its businesses to meet its future strategic objectives. The Bank’s businesses and operations are exposed to a broad number of risks that have been identified and defined in the Enterprise Risk Framework. The Ba nk’s tolerance to those risks is defined in the Enterprise Risk Appetite which has been developed within a comprehensive framework that takes into consideration current conditions in which the Bank operates and the impact that emerging risks will have on TD’s strategy and risk profile. The Bank’s risk appetite states that it takes risks required to build its business, but only if those risks: (1) fit t he business strategy and can be understood and managed; (2) do not expose the enterprise to any significant single loss events; TD does not ‘bet the bank’ on any single acquisition, business, or product; and (3) do not risk harming the TD brand. Each business is responsible for setting and aligning its i ndividual risk appetites with that of the enterprise based on a thorough examination of the specific risks to which it is exposed. The Bank considers it critical to regularly assess its oper ating environment and highlight top and emerging risks. These are risks with a potential to have a material effect on the Bank and where the attention of senior leaders is focused due to the potential magnitude or immediacy of their impact. Risks are identified, discussed, and actioned by senior leaders and reported quarterly to the Risk Committee. Specific plans to mitigate top and emerging risks are prepared, monitor ed, and adjusted as required. The Bank’s risk governance structure and risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. Additional information on risk factors can be found in this document and the 2022 MD&A under the heading “Risk Factors and Management”. For a complete discussion of the risk governance structure and the risk management approach, refer to the “Managing Risk” section in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. The shaded sections of this MD&A represent a discussion relating to market and liquidity risks and form an integral part of the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended July 31, 2023. Gross credit risk exposure, also referred to as exposure at default (EAD), is the total amount the Bank is exposed to at the time of default of a loan and is measured before counterparty-specific provisions or write-offs. Gross credit risk exposure does not reflect the effects of credit risk mitigation (CRM) and includes both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. On-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of outstanding loans, acceptances, non-trading securities, de rivatives, and certain other repo-style transactions. Off-balance sheet exposures consist primarily of undrawn commitments, guarantees, and certain other repo-style transactions. Gross credit risk exposures for the two approaches the Bank uses to measure credit risk are inc luded in the following table.

GMR is det ermined by cr eating a distribution of potential changes in t he market value of the current portfolio using historical simulation. The Bank values the c urrent portfolio using the market price and rate changes of the most recent 259 trading days for equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity products. GMR is com puted as t he threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed mor e than one out of every 100 trading days. A one-day holding period is used for GMR calculation, which is scaled up to ten days for regulatory capital calculation purposes. IDSR measures idiosyncratic (single-name) credit spread risk for credit exposures in the trading portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation. The IDSR model is b ased on the historical behaviour of fi ve-year idiosyncratic credit spreads. Similar to GMR, IDSR is computed as the threshold level that portfolio losses are not expected to exceed m ore than one out of every 100 trading days. IDSR is measured for a ten-day holding period. The following graph discloses daily one-day VaR usage and trading net revenue, reported on a TEB, within Wholesale Banking. Trading net revenue includes trading income and net interest income related to posit ions within the Bank’s market risk capital trading books. For the quarter ended July 31, 2023, t here were 5 days of trading losses and trading net revenue was positive for 92% of the trading days, reflecting normal trading activity. Losses in the quarter did not exceed VaR on any trading day.

The Bank continuously improves its VaR methodologies and incorporates new risk measures in li ne with market conventions, industry best practices, and regulatory requirements. To mitigate some of the short comings of VaR, t he Bank uses additional metrics designed for risk management and capital purposes. These include Stressed VaR, IRC, Stress Testing, and sensitivities to various market risk factors. Calculating Stressed VaR In addi tion to VaR, the Bank also calculates Stressed VaR, which includes Stressed GMR and Stressed IDSR. Stressed VaR is designed to measure the adverse impact that potential changes in m arket rates and prices could have on the value of a portfolio over a specified period of stressed market conditions. Stressed VaR is deter mined using similar techniques and assumptions as GMR and IDSR VaR. However, instead of using the most recent 259 trading days (one year), the Bank uses a periodically reviewed and selected year of stressed mar ket conditions. In the third quarter of 2023, St ressed VaR was calculated using the one-year period that includes the 2008 financial crisis. Stressed VaR is a part of regulatory capital requirements. Calculating the Incremental Risk Charge The IRC is applied to all instr uments in the t rading book subject to migration and default risk. Migration risk represents the risk of changes in the credit ratings of the Bank’s exposures. TD applies a Monte Carlo simulation with a one-year horizon and a 99.9% confidence level to determine IRC, which is consistent with regulatory requirements. IRC is based on a “constant level of risk” assumption, which requires banks to assi gn a liquidity horizon to positions that are subject to IRC. IRC is a part of regulatory capital requirements.",
        "summary": "The Bank's third-quarter 2023 report outlines its approach to calculating Value-at-Risk (VaR) for its trading positions, combining General Market Risk (GMR) and Idiosyncratic Debt Specific Risk (IDSR). GMR is assessed using historical simulation over the past 259 trading days, while IDSR uses Monte Carlo simulation based on five-year credit spreads. Both are calculated to ensure losses do not exceed the threshold more than once in 100 trading days. The report notes that during the quarter, trading net revenue was positive 92% of the time, with no losses exceeding VaR. The Bank acknowledges VaR's limitations, such as its reliance on historical data and assumptions about liquidity, and supplements it with additional risk measures like Stressed VaR, Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), and stress testing. Stressed VaR uses data from stressed market conditions, such as the 2008 financial crisis, and is part of regulatory capital requirements. IRC accounts for migration and default risk using a Monte Carlo simulation with a one-year horizon and a 99.9% confidence level."

It is not meaningful to compute a diversification effect because the high and low may occur on different days for different ris k types. Average VaR decreased quarter over quarter driven by changes in f ixed income positions combined with narrower credit spreads. Average VaR and Stressed VaR decreased year over year due to changes in fixed income positions. Average IRC decreased year over year, however increased quarter over quarter due to changes in bond positions. Validation of VaR Model The Bank uses a back-testing process to compare the actual and theoretical profit and losses to VaR to ensur e that they are consistent with the statistical results of the VaR model. The theoretical profit or loss is generated using the daily price movements on the assumption that there is no change in the composition of the portfolio. Validation of the IRC model must follow a different approach since the one-year horizon and 99.9% confidence level preclude standard back-testing techniques. Instead, key parameters of the IRC model such as transition and correlation matrices are subject to independent validation by benchmarking against external study results or through analysis using internal or external data. Structural (Non-Trading) Interest Rate Risk The Bank’s structural interest rate risk arises from traditional personal and commercial banking activity and is generally the result of m ismatches between the maturities and repricing dates of the Bank’s assets and liabilities. The measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book does not include exposures from TD’s Wholesale Banking or Insurance businesses. The primary measures for this risk are Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) Sensitivity and Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS). The EVE Sensitivity measures the impact of a specified interest rate shock to the change in the net pr esent value of the Bank’s banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items. It reflects a measurement of the potential present value impact on shareholders’ equity without an assumed term profile for the management of the Bank’s own equity and excludes product margins. The NIIS measures the NII change over a twelve-month horizon for a specified change in interest rates for banking book assets, liabilities, and certain off balance sheet items assuming a constant balance sheet over the period. The Bank’s Market Risk policy sets overall limits on the structural interest rate risk measures. These limits are periodically reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee. In addition to the Board policy limits, book-level risk limits are set for the Bank’s management of non-trading interest rate risk by Risk Management. Exposures against these limits are routinely monitored and reported, and breaches of the Board limits, if any, are escalated to both the Asset/Liability and Capital Committee (ALCO) and the Risk Committee. The following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rates on the EVE and NIIS measures. Interest rate floors are applied by currency to the decrease in r ates such that they do not exceed expected lower bounds, with the most material currencies set to a floor of -25 bps.

Since these swaps were pre- existing hedges which economica lly hedge the Bank’s non-trading market risk, their inclusion had no impact on the quarter-over-quarter results. This str ategy was discontinued following the announcement on May 4, 2023 by the bank and First Horizon that they had entered into a mutual agreement to terminate the previously announced merger agreement. As at July 31, 2023, an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase in interest rates would have had a negative impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,415 million, a decrease of $267 million from last quarter, and a positive impact to the Bank’s NII of $984 million, an increase of $199 mi llion from last quarter. An immediate and sustained 100 bps decrease in interest rates would have had a positive impact to the Bank’s EVE of $1,003 million, a decrease of $103 m illion from last quarter, and a negative impact to the Bank’s NII of $1,155 million, an increase of $245 million from last quarter. The quarter-over- quar ter decrease in up shock EVE is primarily due to a decrease in the duration of assets supported by equity. The quarter -over-quarter increase in NII Sensitivity is primarily due to non-maturity deposits hedge decay, partially offset by d eposit attrition and changes in deposit composition.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights several key insights regarding its portfolio market risk measures and structural interest rate risk. The average Value-at-Risk (VaR) decreased both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, primarily due to changes in fixed income positions and narrower credit spreads. The Incremental Risk Capital Charge (IRC) increased quarter-over-quarter due to changes in bond positions but decreased year-over-year. The bank employs a back-testing process to validate its VaR model and uses independent validation for its IRC model.\n\nRegarding structural interest rate risk, the report notes that a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would negatively impact the Economic Value of Shareholders’ Equity (EVE) by $1,415 million, a decrease from the previous quarter, while positively impacting Net Interest Income (NII) by $984 million, an increase from the previous quarter. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in rates would positively impact EVE by $1,003 million but negatively impact NII by $1,155 million. These changes are attributed to factors such as asset duration and non-maturity deposit hedge decay. The bank's market risk policy sets limits on structural interest rate risk, which are monitored and reported regularly."

Financial obligations can arise from deposit withdrawals, debt maturities, commitments to pr ovide credit or l iquidity support, or the need to pledge additional collateral. TD’S LIQUIDITY RISK APPETITE The Bank maintains a prudent and disciplined approach to managing its potential exposure to l iquidity risk. The Bank targets a 90-day survival horizon under a combined bank-specific and market-wide stress scenario, and a minimum buffer over regulatory requirements prescribed by OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) guidelines. Under the LAR guidelines, Canadian banks are required to m aintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at the mini mum of 100% other than during periods of financial stress and to maintain a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at the minimum of 100% . The Bank’s funding program emphasizes maximizing deposits as a core source of funding and having ready access to w holesale funding markets across diversified terms, funding types, and currencies that is designed to ensure low exposure to a sudden contraction of wholesal e funding capacity and to m inimize structural liquidity gaps. The Bank also maintains a contingency funding plan to enhance pr eparedness for recovery from potential liquidity stress events. The Bank’s strategies and actions comprise an integrated liquidity risk management program that is designed to ensure low exposure to liquidity risk and compliance with regulatory requirements. The Bank’s ALCO oversees the Bank’s liquidity risk management program. It ensures there are effective management structures and practices in place to properly measure and manage liquidity risk. The Global Liquidity & Funding Committee, a subcommittee of the ALCO comprised of seni or management from Treasury, Risk Management and Wholesale Banking, identifies and monitors the Bank’s liquidity risks. The management of l iquidity risk is the responsibility of the SET member responsible for Treasury, while oversight and challenge is provided by t he ALCO and independently by R isk Management. The Risk Committee regularly reviews the Bank’s liquidity position and approves the Bank’s Liquidity Risk Management Framework bi- annual ly and the related policies annually. The Bank has established TD Group US H olding LLC (TDGUS) as TD’s U.S. Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), as well as a Combined U.S. Operations (CUSO) reporting unit that consists of the IHC and TD’s U.S. branch and agency network. Both TDGUS and CUSO are managed to the U .S. Enhanced Prudential Standards liquidity requirements in addi tion to the Bank’s liquidity management framework. The Bank’s liquidity risk appetite and liquidity risk management approach have not substantially changed from that described in the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. For a complete discussion of liquidity risk, refer to the “Liquidity Risk” section in t he Bank’s 2022 Annual Report. iquid assets The unencumbered liquid assets the Bank holds to m eet its liquidity requirements must be hi gh-quality securities that the Bank believes can be monetized quickly in st ress conditions with minimum loss in market value. The liquidity value of unencum bered liquid assets considers estimated market or trading depths, settlement timing, and/or other identified impediments to potent ial sale or pledgi ng. Overall, the Bank expects any reduction in m arket value of i ts liquid asset portfolio to be modest given its underlying high credit quality and demonstrated liquidity. Assets held by the Bank to meet liquidity requirements are summarized in the f ollowing tables. The tables do not include assets held within the Bank’s insurance businesses as these are used to support insurance-specific liabilities and capital requirements. l TD BANK GROUP • THIRD QUARTER 2023 • REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS Page 36 31: SUMMARY OF LIQUID ASSETS BY TYPE AND CURRENCY 1 , 2 1 Liquid assets include collateral received that can be re-hypot hecated or otherwise redeployed. 2 Positions stated include gross asse t values pertaining to securities financing transactions.

Where a partic ular asset has been encumbered and TD has holdings of the a sset both on-balance sheet and off balance sheet, for the purpose of this disclosure, the o n- and off-bala nce sheet holdings are encumbered in alignment with the business practice. 2 Assets received as collateral through off-balance sheet transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing, margin loans , and other client activity. 3 Represents assets t hat have been posted externally to s upport the Bank’s day-to-day operations, i ncluding securities financing transactions, clearing and payments, and derivative transactions. Also includes assets that ha ve been pledged supporting Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) activity . 4 Assets supporting TD’s long-term funding activities, assets pledged against securitization liabilities, and assets held by consolidated securitization vehicles or in po ols for covered bond issuance. 5 Assets that ar e considered readily available in their curre nt legal form to generate funding or support collateral needs. This category includes reported FHLB assets that remain unutilized and DSAC that are available for collateral purposes however not regularly utilized in practice. 6 Assets t hat cannot be used to support funding or collateral requirements in their current form. This category includes those assets that are potenti ally eligible as funding program collateral or for pledg ing to central banks (for example, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation insured mortgages that can be se curitized into NHA MBS). 7 Includes trading loans, securities, non-trading financial assets at FVTPL and other financial assets designated at FVTPL, fina ncial assets at FVOCI, and DSAC. 8 Assets reported in the “Bank-owned assets” column repr esent the value of the loans extended and not the value of the collat eral received. The loan value from the reverse repurchase transactions is deducted from the “ Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” colu mn to avoid double-counting with the on -balance sheet assets. 9 The loan value from the margin loans/client activity is deducted from the “ Securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions” column to avoid double counting with the o n-balance sheet assets. 10 Other assets include investment in Schwab, goodwill, other intangibles, land, buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets, deferred tax assets, am ounts receivable from brokers, dealers, and clients, and oth er assets on the balance sheet not reported in the above categories. In addition to the Severe Combined Stress Scenario, the Bank performs liquidity stress testing on multiple alternate scenarios. These scenarios are a mix of TD spe cific events and market-wide stress events designed to test the impact from risk factors material to the Bank’s risk profile. Liquidity assessments are also part of the Bank’s Enterprise-Wide Stress Testing program. The Bank has liquidity contingency funding plans (CFP) in place at the overall Bank level and for certain subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions (Regional CFPs). The Bank’s CFP provides a documented framework for managing unexpected liquidity situations and thus is an integral component of the Bank’s overall liquidity risk management program. It outlines different contingency levels based on the severity and duration of the liquidity situation and identifies recovery ac tions appropriate for each level. For each recovery action, it provides key operational steps required to execut e the action. Regional CFPs i dentify recovery actions to address region-specific stress events. The actions and governance structure outlined in the Bank’s CFP are aligned with the Bank’s Crisis Management Recovery Plan. Credit ratings impact the Bank’s borrowing costs and ability to raise funds. Rating downgrades could potentially result in higher financing costs, increased requirements to pledge collateral, reduced access to capital markets, and could also affect the Bank’s abi lity to enter into derivative transactions. Credit ratings and outlooks provided by rating agencies reflect their views and are subject to change from time-to- t ime, based on a number of factors including the Bank’s financial strength, competitive position, and liquidity, as well as factors not entirely within the Bank’s control, including the methodologies used by rating agencies and conditions affecting the overall financial services industry.",
        "summary": "The financial text from TD Bank Group's Third Quarter 2023 Report to Shareholders provides a detailed breakdown of the bank's encumbered and unencumbered assets as of July 31, 2023. The report categorizes assets into various types, such as cash, interest-bearing deposits, securities, derivatives, loans, and other assets, and specifies which are pledged as collateral or available for collateral purposes.

These activities include clearing, custody, or cash management services. 7 Includes uncommitted credit and liquidity f acilities, stable value money market mutual funds, outst anding debt securities with remaining mat urity greater than 30 days, and other contract ual cash outflows. With respect to outstanding debt securities with remaining maturity greater than 30 days, TD has no contr actual obligation to buy back these outstanding TD debt se curities, and as a res ult, a 0% outflow rate is applied under the OSFI LAR guideline. 8 Total HQLA includes both asset haircut s and applicable caps, as prescr ibed by the OSFI LA R guideline (HQLA assets after haircuts are capped at 40% for Level 2 and 15% for Level 2B). 9 Total Net Cash Outflows include both inflow and outflow rates and applicable caps, as prescribed by the OSFI LAR guideline (inflows are capped at 75% of outflows). The Bank’s average LCR of 133% for the quarter ended July 31, 2023 continues to meet the regulatory requirements. The Bank holds a variety of liquid assets commensurate with the liquidity needs of the organization. Many of these assets qualify as HQLA under the OSFI LAR guideline. The average HQLA of the Bank for the quarter ended July 31, 2023 was $324 billion (April 30, 2023 – $347 billion), with Level 1 assets representing 83% (April 30, 2023 – 86%). The Bank’s reported HQLA excludes excess HQLA from the U.S. Retail operations, as required by the OSFI LAR guideline, to reflect liquidity transfer considerations between U.S. Retail and its affiliates as a result of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board’s regulations. By excluding excess HQLA, the U.S. Retail LCR is effectively capped at 100% prior to total Bank consolidation. As des cribed in the “How TD Manages Liquidity Risk” section of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Report, the Bank manages its HQLA and other liquidity buffers to the higher of TD’s 90-day surplus requirement and the target buffers over regulatory requirements from the LCR, NSFR, and the Net Cumulative Cash Flow (NCCF) me trics. As a result, the total stock of H QLA is subject to ongoing rebalancing against the projected liquidity requirements. The NSFR is a Basel III metric calculated as the ratio of total available stable funding (ASF) over total required stable funding (RSF) in accordance with OSFI’s LAR guideline. The Bank must maintain an NSFR ratio equal to or above 100% in accor dance with the LAR guideline. The Bank’s ASF comprises the Bank’s liability and capital instruments (including deposits and wholesale funding). The assets that require stable funding are based on the Bank’s on and off-balance sheet activities and a function of their liquidity characteristics and the requirements of OSFI’s LAR guideline.",

MATURITY ANALYSIS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS The following table summarizes on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet categories by remaining contractual maturity. Off-balance sheet commitments include contractual obligations to make future payments on certain lease-related commitments, certain purchase obligations, and other liabilities. The values of credit instruments reported in the following table represent the maximum amount of additional credit that the Bank could be obligated to extend should such instruments be fully drawn or utilized. Since a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the contractual amounts is not r epresentative of expected future liquidity requirements. These contractual obligations have an impact on the Bank’s short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. The maturity analysis presented does not depict t he degree of the Bank’s maturity transformation or the Bank’s exposure to interest rate and liquidity risk. The Bank ensures that assets are appropriately funded to protect against borrowing cost volatility and potential reductions to funding market availability. The Bank utilizes stable non-maturity deposits (chequing and savings accounts) and term deposits as the primary source of long-term funding for the Bank’s non-trading assets including personal and business term loans and the stable balance of revolving lines of credit. Additionally, the Bank issues long-term funding in respect of su ch non-trading assets and rai ses short term funding primarily to finance trading assets. The liquidity of trading assets under stressed market conditions is co nsidered when determining the appropriate term of the funding.

Guideline B-15 is iterative and is currently organized into interrelated and mutually reinforcing chapters, Chapter 1 – Governance and Risk Management Expectations and Chapter 2 – Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Components of G uideline B-15 are initially effective for D-SIBs for fiscal year-end 2024, where annual disclosures are required to be made publicly available no later than 180 days after fiscal year-end. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopting Guideline B-15. ISSB – IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 On June 26, 2023, t he International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the IFRS Foundation, issued its first two sustainability standards, IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosures of Sustai nability-related Financial Information (S1) and IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures (S2). S1 sets out the disclosure requirements for financially material information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities to meet investor information needs, and S2 specifically sets the disclosure requirement for Climate-related risks and opportunities. ISSB recommends an effective date for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and thi s is subj ect to Canadian jurisdiction’s endorsement. Early application is per mitted on or before the date of initial application of IFRS S1 and S2. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has officially endorsed IFRS S1 and S2 on July 23, 2023, and is now calling its member jurisdictions to consider ways they may adopt or apply the I SSB standards. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of adopt ing these standards. CURITIZATION AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS he Bank enters into securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of oper ations. The Bank is involved with structured entities (SEs) that it sponsors, as well as entities sponsored by third parties. Refer to “Securitization and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section, Note 9: Transfers of Financial Assets and Note 10: Structured Entities of t he Bank’s 2022 Annual Report for further details. There have been no significant changes to t he Bank’s securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended July 31, 2023. Securitization of Third Party-Originated Assets Significant Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities The Bank securitizes third party-originated assets through Bank-sponsored SEs, including its Canadian multi-seller conduits which are not consolidated. These Canadian multi-seller conduits securitize Canadian originated third-party assets. The Bank administers these multi-seller conduits and provides liquidity facilities as well as securities distribution services; it may also provide credit enhancements. TD’s maximum potential exposure to loss due to its ownership interest in c ommercial paper and through the provision of l iquidity facilities for multi-seller conduits was $13.7 billion as at July 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $10.8 billion). In a ddition, as at July 31, 2023, the Bank had committed to pr ovide $1.4 billion in l iquidity facilities that can be used to support future asset-backed commercial paper in the pur chase of deal-specific assets (October 31, 2022 – $2.1 billion). Off-Balance Sheet Exposure to Third Party-Sponsored Conduits The Bank has off-balance sheet exposure to third party-sponsored conduits arising from providing liquidity facilities and funding commitments of $3. 8 billion as at July 31, 2023 (October 31, 2022 – $3.1 billion). The assets within these conduits are comprised of individual notes backed by automotive loan receivables, credit card receivables, equipment receivables and trade receivables. On-balance sheet exposure to thi rd party-sponsored conduits have been included in the financial statements. he Bank’s unaudited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accor dance with IFRS. For details of t he Bank’s accounting policies under IFRS, refer to N ote 2 of the Bank’s third quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. For details of the Bank’s significant accounting judgments, estimates, and assumptions under IFRS, refer to N ote 3 of the Bank’s third quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. There were no new accounting policies that have been adopted by the Bank for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023. ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The estimates used in t he Bank’s accounting policies are essential to understandi ng its results of oper ations and financial condition. Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they rel ate to mat ters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or est imates and changes to accounting standards and policies could have a materially adverse impact on t he Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has established procedures to ensu re that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and a dopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The ECL model requires the application of est imates and judgment in t he assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environment. There remains elevated economic uncertainty, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in assessing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualitative adjustments have been applied. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Various interest rates and other indices that are deemed to be “benchmarks” (including Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR)) have been, and continue to be, the subject of international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. As a result of the gl obal benchmark reform initiative, efforts to tr ansition away from IBORs to alternative reference rates (ARR) have either concluded or have been continuing in var ious jurisdictions. Following previous announcements by various regulators, the publication has ceased for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and euro LIBOR settings, as w ell as the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings effective December 31, 2021. From June 30, 2023, all remaining USD LIBOR tenors have either ceased or are published only on a synthet ic basis for the use in legacy contracts that have no other fallback solution. Six-month and twelve-month CDOR tenors ceased to be",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights several key regulatory and financial developments. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) issued Guideline B-15 on March 7, 2023, focusing on climate risk management and disclosure, effective for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) by fiscal year-end 2024. The bank is assessing the impact of this guideline. Additionally, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) released its first sustainability standards, IFRS S1 and S2, on June 26, 2023, which have been endorsed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). These standards focus on sustainability-related financial disclosures and climate-related risks, with an effective date from January 1, 2024.\n\nIn terms of securitization and off-balance sheet arrangements, TD Bank continues its involvement with structured entities, including Canadian multi-seller conduits, with a maximum potential exposure of $13.7 billion as of July 31, 2023. The bank also has off-balance sheet exposure to third-party-sponsored conduits amounting to $3.8 billion.\n\nThe report notes no new accounting policies adopted in the quarter, but emphasizes the importance of estimates and judgments in financial reporting, particularly under the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model amid economic uncertainty. The bank is also navigating the global interest rate benchmark reform, transitioning from Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) to alternative reference rates (ARR)."

In July 2023, the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate working group introduced a “no new CDOR or Banker’s Acceptance l oan” milestone date of November 1, 2023 to facilitate a tapered transition for the loan market by reducing the volume of loans that need to be remediated ahead of CDOR’s cessation. The Bank has incorporated these developments into its benchmark rate reform plan. To ensure an or derly transition, the Bank continues to monitor developments and incorporate global working groups’ and regulators’ best practice guidance on transition activities. These activities include, but are not limited to, making a vailable new products referencing ARRs, preparing to cease t he issuance of the residual CDOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy contracts by incorporating appropriate fallback language, and preparing for overall operational readiness. The Bank continues to make pr ogress on i ts CDOR transition plan. There were no significant changes to the Bank’s transition risk with respect to the remaining CDOR exposures since October 31, 2022. For further details regarding interest rate benchmark reform, refer to N ote 3 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. The following standard has been issued, but is not yet effective on the dat e of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) which replaces the guidance in IFR S 4, Insurance Contracts and establishes principles for recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of i nsurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups which are measured at the ri sk adjusted present value of cash fl ows in f ulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recogni zed as insurance contract services are provided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expect ed to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, w hich will be November 1, 2023, for the Bank. OSFI’s related Advisory precludes early adoption. The Bank will apply the standard retrospectively with restatement of comparat ives, where it will recognize the cumulative effect of adopt ing the standard as an adjustment to the openi ng retained earnings balance as of November 1, 2022. The Bank is progressing with its adoption of IFRS 17 initiative which is support ed by a robust gover nance structure. The Executive Steering Committee includes representation from the Insurance business, Finance, Actuaries, Risk, Technology, and project management teams. Updates are also provided to the TD insurance subsidiary boards, Risk Committee, and Audit Committee of the Bank. During the most recent interim period, there have been no changes in the Bank’s policies and procedures and other processes that comprise its internal control over financial reporting, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting.",
        "summary": "The text outlines TD Bank Group's progress and plans regarding two major financial regulatory changes. First, it discusses the transition from the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) to alternative reference rates (ARRs), with a milestone date set for November 1, 2023, to cease new CDOR-based loans. The bank is actively preparing for this transition by developing new ARR products, ceasing CDOR-based instruments, and updating legacy contracts. Second, the text covers the adoption of IFRS 17, a new standard for insurance contracts effective from November 1, 2023.

To arrive at ad justed results, the Bank adjusts for “items of note”, f rom reported results. The items of note relate to items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance. Allowance for Credit Losses: Represent expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets, including any off-balance sheet exposures, at the balance sheet date. Allowance for credit losses consists of Stage 3 allowance for impaired financial assets and Stage 2 and Stage 1 allowance for performing financial assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The allowance is increased by the provision for credit losses, decreased by write-offs net of recoveries and disposals, and impacted by foreign exchange. Amortized Cost: The amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization, using EIRM, of any differences between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. Assets under Administration (AUA): Assets that are beneficially owned by cu stomers where the Bank provides services of an administrative nature, such as the collection of investment income and the placing of trades on behalf of the clients (where the client has made his or her own investment selection). The majority of these assets are not reported on the B ank’ s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets under Management (AUM): Assets that are beneficially owned by cu stomers, managed by the Bank, where the Bank has discretion to make investment selections on behalf of the client (in accordance with an investment policy). In addition to the TD family of mutual funds, the Bank manages assets on behalf of individuals, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments and foundations. These assets are not r eported on the Bank’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Some assets under management that are also administered by the Bank are included in assets under administration. Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP): A form of commercial paper that is collateralized by other financial assets. Institutional investors usually purchase such instruments in order to diversify their assets and generate short-term gains. Asset-Backed Securities (ABS): A security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized (or “backed”) by a specified pool of underlying assets. Average Common Equity: Average common equity for the business segments reflects the average allocated capital. The Bank’s methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Average Interest-Earning Assets: A non-GAAP financial measure that depicts the Bank’s financial position, and is calculated as the average carrying value of de posits with banks, loans and securities based on daily balances for the period ending October 31 in each fiscal year. Basic Earnings per Share (EPS): A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Adjusted basic EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net i ncome. Basis Points (bps): A unit equal to 1/100 of 1%. Thus, a 1% change is equal to 100 basis points. Book Value per Share: A measure calculated by dividing common shareholders’ equity by number of common shares at the end of the period. Carrying Value: The value at which an asset or liability is carried at on t he Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO): They are collateralized debt obligations consisting of mortgage-backed securities that are separated and issued as different classes of mortgage pass-through securities with different te rms, interest rates, and risks. CMOs by private issuers are collectively referred to as non-agency CMOs. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital: This is a primary Basel III capital measure comprised mainly of common equity, retained earnings and qualifying non-controlling interest in subsidiaries. Regulatory deductions made to arrive at the CET1 Capital include goodwill and intangibles, unconsolidated investments in banking, financial, and insurance entities, deferred tax assets, de fined benefit pension fund assets, and shortfalls in allowances. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital Ratio: CET1 Capital ratio represents the predominant measure of capital adequacy under Basel III and equals CET1 Capital divided by RWA. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): A measure of growth over multiple time periods from the initial investment value to the ending investment value assuming that the investment has been compounding o ver the time period. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA): CVA represents a capital char ge that measures credit risk due to default of derivative counterparties. This charge requires banks to capitalize for the potential changes in counterparty credit spread for the derivative portfolios. Diluted EPS: A performance measure calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusting for the effect of all potentially dilutive common shares. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Dividend Payout Ratio: A ratio represents the percentage of Bank’s earnings be ing paid to common shareholders in the form of dividends and is calculated by dividing common dividends by net income available to common shareholders. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net i ncome. Dividend Yield: A ratio calculated as the dividend per common share for the year divided by the daily average closing stock price during the year. Effective Income Tax Rate: A rate and per formance indicator calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes as a percentage of net income before taxes. Adjusted effective income tax rate is calculated in the same manner using adjusted results. Effective Interest Rate (EIR): The rate that discounts expected future cash flows for the expected life of the financial instrument to its carrying value. The calculation takes into account the contractual interest rate, along with any fees or incremental costs that are directly attributable to the instrument and all other premiums or discounts. Effective Interest Rate Method (EIRM): A technique for calculating the actual interest rate in a period based on the amount of a financial instrument’s book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Under EIRM, the effective interest rate, which is a key component of the calculation, discounts the expected future cash inflows and outflows expected over the life of a financial instrument. Efficiency Ratio: The efficiency ratio measures operating efficiency and is ca lculated by t aking the non-interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue. A lower ratio indicates a more efficient business operation. Adjusted efficiency ratio is calculated in the same manner using adjusted non-interest ex penses and total revenue.",

Expected Credit Losses (ECLs): ECLs are the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument and considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of f uture events and economic conditions that impact the Bank’s credit risk assessment. Fair Value: The price that would be received to sel l an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, under current market conditions. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Under IFRS 9, if the asset passes the contractual cash flows test (named SPPI), the business model assessment determines how the instrument is classi fied. If the instrument is being hel d to col lect contractual cash flows, that is, if it is not expected to be sold, it is measured as amort ized cost. If the business model for the instrument is to both collect contractual cash flows and potentially sell the asset, it is measured at FVOC I. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Under IFRS 9, the classification is dependent on two tests, a contractual cash flow test (named SPPI) and a business model assessment. Unless the asset meets the requirements of both tests, it is measured at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in profit or loss. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): A U.S. government corporation which provides deposit insurance guaranteeing the safety of a depositor’s accounts in m ember banks. The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages banks in r eceiverships (failed banks). Forward Contracts: Over-the-counter contracts between two parties that oblige one party to the contract to buy and t he other party to sell an asset for a fixed price at a future date. Futures: Exchange-traded contr acts to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Hedging: A risk management technique intended to mitigate the Bank’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or o ther market factors. The elimination or reduction of such exposure is accomplished by engaging in capi tal markets activities to establish offsetting positions. Impaired Loans: Loans where, in m anagement ’s opinion, there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent that the Bank no longer has reasonable assurance as to the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. Loss Given Default (LGD): It is the amount of the loss the Bank would likely incur when a borrower defaults on a l oan, which is expr essed as a percentage of exposure at default. Mark-to-Market (MTM): A valuation that reflects current market rates as at the balance sheet date for financial instruments that are carried at fair value. Master Netting Agreements: Legal agreements between two parties that have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provide for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment, in a single cur rency, in t he event of default or termination of any one contract. Net Corporate Expenses: Non-interest expenses related to cor porate service and control groups which are not allocated to a business segm ent. Net Interest Margin: A non-GAAP ratio calculated as net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets to measure performance. This metric is an indicator of t he profitability of t he Bank’s earning assets less the cost of funding. Adjusted net interest margin is cal culated in t he same manner using adjusted net interest income. Non-Viability Contingent Capital (NVCC): Instruments (preferred shares and subordinated debt) that contain a feature or a provision that allows the financial institution to ei ther permanently convert these instruments into common shares or fully write-down the instrument, in the event that the institution is no longer viable.

Price-Earnings Ratio: A ratio calculated by dividing the closing share price by EPS based on a trailing four quarters to indicate mar ket performance. Adjusted p rice-earnings ratio is cal culated in the same manner using adjusted EPS. Probability of Default (PD): It is the likelihood that a borrower will not be able to m eet its scheduled repayments. Provision for Credit Losses (PCL): Amount added to the al lowance for credit losses to bring it to a level that management considers adequate to reflect e xpected credit-related losses on its portfolio. Return on Common Equity (ROE): The consolidated Bank ROE is calcul ated as net income available to com mon shareholders as a per centage of average common shareholders’ equity, utilized in assessing t he Bank’s use of equity. ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. Adjusted ROE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Return on Risk-weighted Assets: Net income available to com mon shareholders as a per centage of average risk-weighted assets. Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE): A non-GAAP financial measure calculated as repor ted net income available to common shareholders after adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquir ed intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a per centage of average Tangible common e quity. Adjusted ROTCE is calculated in the same manner using adjusted net income. Both measures can be uti lized in assessing t he Bank’s use of equity. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA): Assets calculated by applying a regulatory risk-weight factor to on and off-balance sheet exposures. The risk-weight factors are established by the OSFI to convert on and off-balance sheet exposures to a com parable risk level. Securitization: The process by w hich financial assets, mainly loans, are transferred to st ructures, which normally issue a series of asset-backed securities to i nvestors to fund the purchase of loans.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 financial report highlights several key insights:\n\n1. **Balance Sheet Overview**: Total assets decreased slightly from $1,917.5 billion in October 2022 to $1,887.1 billion in July 2023. Loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased to $867.8 billion from $831.0 billion, while deposits decreased to $1,159.5 billion from $1,230.0 billion.\n\n2. **Income Statement Highlights**: Net income for the three months ended July 31, 2023, was $2.963 billion, down from $3.214 billion in the same period in 2022. For the nine months ended July 31, 2023, net income was $7.896 billion, compared to $10.758 billion in 2022. Earnings per share decreased to $1.57 from $1.76 for the quarter.\n\n3. **Revenue and Expenses**: Total revenue for the quarter was $12.779 billion, up from $10.925 billion in the previous year. However, non-interest expenses also increased to $7.582 billion from $6.096 billion, impacting net income.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Income**: The bank reported a total comprehensive loss of $507 million for the quarter, compared to a comprehensive income of $3.063 billion in the same period last year, primarily due to significant losses in other comprehensive income.\n\n5. **Cash Flow Activities**: The bank experienced a net cash outflow from operating activities of $30.8 billion for the quarter, while cash flows from investing activities were positive at $35.6 billion, driven by activities in interest-bearing deposits and debt securities.\n\nOverall, TD Bank Group faced challenges in maintaining net income levels and comprehensive income, despite an increase in total revenue, due to higher expenses and losses in other comprehensive income."

All intercompany transactions , balances, and unre alized gains and losses on transactions are eliminated on consolidation. he Interim Consolidated Financial Statements fo r the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023, were approved and authorized for issue by the Bank’s Board of Directors, in accordance with a recommendation of the Audit Committee, on August 23, 2023. As the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements do not include all of t he disclosures normally provided in the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, they shou ld be read in conjunction with the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes, and t he shaded sections of the 2022 anagement’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). The risk management policies and procedures of t he Bank are provided in the MD&A. The shaded sections of the “Managing Risk” section of the MD&A in this report, relating to market, liquidity, and insurance risks, are an integral part of these Interim Consolidated Financial Sta tements, as permitted by IFRS. NOTE 2: CURRENT AND FUTURE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES There were no new accounting policies that have b een adopted by the Bank for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023. The following standard has been issued, but is not yet effective on the date of issuance of the Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Contracts The IASB issued IFRS 17, In surance Contracts ( IFRS 17) which replaces the guidance in IFRS 4, I nsurance Contracts and e stablishes principles for recognition, mea surement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. Under IFRS 17, insurance contracts are a ggregated into groups which are measured at the risk adjusted present value of cash flows in fulfilling the contracts. Revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are pro vided over the coverage period. Losses are recognized immediately if the contract group is expected to be onerous. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which will be November 1, 2023, for the Bank. OSFI’s related Advi sory precludes early adoption. The Bank will apply the standard retrospectively with restatement of comparatives, where it will recognize the cumulative effect of adopting the standard as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance as of November 1, 2022. The Bank is progressing with its adoption of IFRS 17 initiative which is supported by a robust governance structure. The Executive Steering Committee includes repre sentation from the Insurance business, Finance, Actuaries, Risk, Technology, and proj ect management teams. Updates are also provided to the TD insurance subsidiary boards, Risk Committee, and Audit Committee of the Bank.",
        "summary": "The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank Group) operates in four main segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The bank's interim consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of 2023 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and approved by the Board of Directors on August 23, 2023. These statements are presented in Canadian dollars and require management to make estimates and assumptions. No new accounting policies were adopted during this period. However, the bank is preparing to adopt IFRS 17, a new standard for insurance contracts, effective November 1, 2023. This adoption will involve restating comparatives and adjusting the opening retained earnings balance. The bank has established a governance structure to oversee the implementation of IFRS 17, involving various departments and committees."

Some of the Bank’s policies require subjective, complex judgments and estimates as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these judgments or estimates and change s to accounting standards and policies could have a m aterially adverse impact on th e Bank’s Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bank has establi shed procedures to ensure that accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies, determining estimates, and adopting new accounting standards are well-controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner. Refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consol idated Financial Statements for a des cription of significant accounting judgments, es timates, and assumptions. Impairment – Expected Credit Loss Model The e xpected credit loss (ECL) model requires the application of est imates and judgment in the assessment of the current and forward-looking economic environm ent. There remains elevated economic uncertainty, and management continues to exercise expert credit judgment in ass essing if an exposure has experienced significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and in determining the amount of ECLs at each reporting date. To the extent that certain effects are not fully incorporated into the model calculations, temporary quantitative and qualit ative adjustments have been applied. Inter est Rate Benchmark Reform Various interest rates and other indices that are deemed to be “benchmarks” (including Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) benchmarks such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR)) have been, and continue to be, the subject of international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. As a resul t of the global benchmark refor m initiative, efforts to transition away from IBORs to altern ative reference rates (ARR) have either conclu ded or have been continuing in various jurisdictions. Followi ng previous announcements by various regulators, the publication has ceased for all sterli ng, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and euro LI BOR settings, as well as the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings effective December 31, 2021. From June 30, 2023, all rema ining USD LIBOR tenors have either ceased or are publishe d only on a synthetic basis for the use in legacy contracts that have no other fallback solution. Six-month and twelve-month CDOR tenors ceased to be published effective May 17, 2021, while the remaining tenors of CD OR (one-month, two-month, and three-month) will cease following a final publication on June 28, 2024. In July 2023, the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate working group introduced a “no new CDOR or Banker’s Acceptance loan” miles tone date of November 1, 2023 to facilitate a tapered transition for the loan market by reducing the volume of loans that need to be rem ediated ahead of CDO R’s cessation. The Bank has incorporated these developments into its bench mark rate reform plan. To ensure an orderly transition, the Bank continues to monitor developments and incorporate global working groups’ and regulators’ best practice guidance on transition activities. These activities include, but are not limited to, making available new products referencing ARRs, preparing to ceas e the issuance of the residual CDOR-based financial instruments, transitioning legacy contracts by incorporat ing appropriate fallback language, and preparing for overall operational readiness. The Bank continues to make progress on its CDOR transition plan. There w ere no significant changes to the Bank’s transition risk with respect to the remaining CDOR exposures since October 31, 2022. For further details regarding interest rate benchmark reform, refer to Note 3 of the Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS There have been no significant changes to the Bank’s a pproach and methodologies used to deter mine fair value measurements for the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023.

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights several key financial insights:\n\n1. **Accounting Judgments and Estimates**: The bank emphasizes the importance of subjective and complex judgments in its accounting policies, which are crucial for understanding its financial results. Changes in these judgments or accounting standards could significantly impact the bank's financial statements.\n\n2. **Expected Credit Loss Model**: The bank uses estimates and judgment to assess credit risk and determine expected credit losses (ECLs), especially amid ongoing economic uncertainty. Temporary adjustments are applied when certain effects are not fully captured in model calculations.\n\n3. **Interest Rate Benchmark Reform**: The bank is actively transitioning from Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) to Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs) due to global benchmark reforms. It is preparing for the cessation of CDOR tenors and ensuring operational readiness for this transition.\n\n4. **Fair Value Measurements**: There have been no significant changes in the bank's methodologies for determining fair value measurements for the period ending July 31, 2023.\n\n5. **Financial Assets and Liabilities**: The report provides a comparison of the carrying and fair values of financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value as of July 31, 2023, and October 31, 2022. There is a slight decrease in the fair value of both assets and liabilities over this period."

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights the bank's allowance for credit losses as of July 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. The total allowance for credit losses increased from $6,921 million in 2022 to $7,774 million in 2023. This increase is primarily due to higher provisions for credit losses across various categories, including residential mortgages, consumer installment and other personal loans, credit cards, and business and government loans. The report also details the allowance for loan losses by stage, showing a significant increase in Stage 2 and Stage 3 allowances, indicating a shift in credit risk assessment. The allowance for off-balance sheet instruments also rose, reflecting a more cautious approach to potential credit losses. Overall, the bank has increased its provisions to address potential credit risks amid changing economic conditions."

Additional risk factors that are industry or segment specific are also inco rporated, where relevant. The key macroeconomic variables used in dete rmining ECLs include regional unemployment rates for all ret ail exposures and regional housing price indices for residential mortgages and home equity lines of cr edit. For business and government loans, the key macroeconomic variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, and credit spreads. Refer to Note 3 of t he Bank’s 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of how forward-looking information is generated and considered in determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and in measuring ECLs. Mac roeconomic Variables Select macroeconomic variables are projected over the forecast period. The following table represents the average values of t he macroeconomic variables over the four calendar quarters starting with the current quarter, and the remaining 4-year forecast period for the base forecast and upside and downside scenarios used in determining the Bank’s ECLs as at July 31, 2023. As the forecast period increases, information about the future becomes less readily available and projections are anc hored on assumptions around structural relationships between economic parameters that are inherently much less certain. Restrictive monetary policy is c ontributing to elevated economic uncertainty and is likely to lead to a near-term deceleration in e conomic growth and a modest increase in unemployment rate.

(f) SENSITIVITY OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ECLs are sensitive to the inputs used in internally developed models, the macroeconomic variables in the forward-looking forecasts and re spective probability weight ings in determining the pr obability-weighted ECLs, and othe r factors considered when applying expert credit judgment. Ch anges in these inputs, assumptions, models, and judgments would affect the assessment of significant increase in credit risk and the m easurement of ECLs. The following table presents the base ECL scenario compared to the probability-weighted ECLs, with the latter derived from three ECL scenarios for performing loans and off-balance sheet instruments. The difference reflects the impact of deriving multiple scenarios around the base ECLs and resultant change in EC Ls due to non-linearity and sensitivity to u sing macroeconomic forecasts.

        "summary": "The text from TD Bank Group's Third Quarter 2023 Report to Shareholders discusses the incorporation of macroeconomic factors into risk parameters for determining Expected Credit Losses (ECLs). Key variables include unemployment rates, GDP, interest rates, and housing prices, which are projected over a forecast period. The report highlights the impact of restrictive monetary policy on economic growth and unemployment. It presents base, upside, and downside scenarios for these variables, noting that projections become less certain over time. The sensitivity of ECLs to these inputs is emphasized, with changes in assumptions affecting credit risk assessments. As of July 31, 2023, the probability-weighted ECLs were higher than the base ECLs, reflecting the impact of multiple scenarios and macroeconomic forecasts. The difference in ECLs from the base to probability-weighted scenarios was 6.8% in 2023, compared to 8.3% in 2022."

Pursuant to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank made sweep deposit accounts available to clie nts of Schwab. Starting July 1, 202 1, Schwab had t he option to reduce the deposits by up to U S$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition, Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain limitations. On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into an amended insured deposit account agreement (the “2023 Schwab IDA Agreement”), which replaced the 2019 S chwab IDA Agreement. In co mparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agr eement extends the initial expiration date by th ree years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until Septem ber 2025, the aggregate amount of fixed rate obligations will serve as t he floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has the option to buy down up to US$5 billion of fixed rate obligations by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to cer tain limits. During the third quarter of 2023, Schwab exercised its option to b uy down $3.3 billion (US$2.4 billion) of fixed rate obligations and paid $151 m illion (US$112 million) in termination fees to t he Bank in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, which is intended to compensate the Bank for losses incurred this quarter from discontinuing certain hedging relationships and lost revenues. The net impact is rec orded in net interest income. NOTE 8: SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS (a) Acquisition of Cowen Inc. On March 1, 2023, the Bank completed the acquisition of Cowen Inc. (“Cowen”). The acquisition advances the Wholesale Banking seg ment’s long-term growth strategy in the U.S. and adds complementary products and services to the Bank’s existing businesses. The results of the acquired business have been consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and primarily reported in the Wholesale Banking segment. Consideration included $1,500 milli on (US $1,100 million) in cash for 100% of C owen’s common shares outstanding, $253 million (US$186 million) for the settlement of Co wen’s Series A Preferred Stoc k, and $205 million (US$151 million) related to th e replacement of share-based payment awards. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method. The purchase price allocation can be adju sted during the measurement period, which shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances. The acquis ition contributed $10,800 million (US$7,933 million) of assets and $9,884 million (US$7,261 million) of liabilities. The excess of ac counting consideration over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired is alloc ated to other intangible assets of $298 million (US$219 million) net of taxes, and g oodwill of $744 million (US$546 million). Goodwill is not d eductible for tax purposes. Since the acquisition date, the contribution of Co wen to the Bank’s revenue and net income was not significant, nor would it have been significant if the acquisition had occurred as of November 1, 2022. The Bank plans to dispose of certain non-core businesses that were acquired in connection with the Cowen acquisition. These non-core businesses are disp osal groups which meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell . The assets and liabilities of these disposal groups are re corded in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Interim Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the third quarter of 2023, the Bank disposed of a reinsurance subsidiary that was classified as held for sale. As at July 31, 2023, assets of $1,241 million and liabilities of $794 million were classified as held for sale.",

The bank's investment in Schwab increased to $8.8 billion as of July 31, 2023, with a share of net income from Schwab amounting to $182 million for the quarter. Schwab's total assets and liabilities decreased compared to the previous year. The 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, replacing the 2019 version, extends the expiration date to 2034 and adjusts deposit balance terms. Schwab exercised an option to reduce fixed rate obligations, paying TD Bank $151 million in termination fees.\n\nAdditionally, TD Bank completed the acquisition of Cowen Inc. on March 1, 2023, for $1.5 billion, enhancing its U.S. Wholesale Banking segment. The acquisition added significant assets and liabilities, with goodwill and other intangibles recorded. Some non-core businesses from the Cowen acquisition are being disposed of, with certain assets and liabilities classified as held for sale.

Under the terms of the termination agreement, the Bank made a $306 million (US$225 million) cash payment to Fir st Horizon on May 5, 2023. The termination payment is recognized in non-interest expenses in the current quarter and is reported in the Corporate segment. In connection with the transaction, the Bank had invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock. During the prior quarter, the Bank recognized a valuation adjustment loss of $199 million (US$147 million) on t his investment, recorded in OCI. On June 26, 2023, in accordance with the terms of the preferred share purchase agreement, the preferred stock converted into approximately 19.7 million common shares of First Horizon, resulting in t he Bank recognizing a loss of $166 million (US$126 million) in O CI based on First Horizon’s common share price at the time of c onversion. Upon conversion, the losses recogni zed to date, including the impact of foreign exchange, were reclassified directly to ret ained earnings. The Bank has el ected to record subsequent fair value changes on the common shares in OCI. The Bank had also implemented a strategy to mi tigate the impact of interest rate volatility to capital on c losing of the acquisition. The Bank determined that the fair value of First Horizon’s fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets would have been sensitive to in terest rate changes. The fair value of ne t assets would have determined the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in go odwill and intangibles would have negatively impacted capital ratios because they are deduc ted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank de -designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships. As a result of the de- designation, mark-to-ma rket gains (losses) on these swaps were recognized in earning s, without any corresponding offset from the previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) would have mitigated the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the acqu isition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments’ basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the inve stments. Prior to the termination of the merger agreement on May 4, 2023, for the three months and nine months ended July 31, 2023, the Bank reported ($125) million and ($1,386) million, respectively, in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $11 million and $262 m illion, respectively, in net interest income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the three months and nine mon ths ended July 31, 2023, the Bank reported $23 million and $585 million, respectively, in non-interest income related to the net interest earned on the swaps. Foll owing the announcement to ter minate the merger agreement, the Bank discontinued this strategy and rein stated hedge accounting on the portfolio of fixed income investments.

The bank's common shares saw a slight decrease in number but an increase in value compared to the previous year. The bank issued shares through stock options and a dividend reinvestment plan, while also repurchasing shares under a normal course issuer bid (NCIB). The bank plans to terminate its existing NCIB and launch a new one to repurchase up to 90 million common shares. Preferred shares and other equity instruments remained stable in number and value. The bank recognized stock option compensation expenses and granted 2.5 million stock options in the nine months ended July 31, 2023.

This bill enacted the Canada Recovery Dividend (C RD) and increased the Canadian federal tax r ate for bank and life insurer groups by 1.5%. The implementation of the CRD resulted in a provision for income taxes of $553 million and a charge to OCI of $239 million, recognized in t he first quarter of 2023. The increase in the Canadian federal tax rate of 1.5%, prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, resulted in a provision for income taxes of $82 million and a tax benefit of $7 5 million in OCI related to fiscal 2022, recognized in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank also remeasured certain Canadian def erred tax assets and liabilities for the increase in tax rate, which resulted in an increase in net deferred tax assets of $50 million, which is r ecorded in provision for income taxes. Other Tax Matters The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), Revenu Québec Agency (RQA) and Al berta Tax and Revenue Administration (ATRA) are de nying certain dividend and inter est deductions claimed by the Bank. During the quarter, the CRA reassessed the Bank for $15 million of additional income tax and interest in respect of its 2018 taxation year, the RQA reassessed the Bank for $12 million of additional income tax and interest in respect of its 2017 taxation year, and the ATRA reassessed the Bank for $17 m illion of additional income tax and interest in respect of its 2017 and 2018 taxation years.

In total, the Bank has been reassessed for $1,783 million of income tax and interest. The Bank expe cts to continue to be reassessed for open years. The Bank is of the view that its tax filing positions were appropriate and filed a Notice of App eal with the Tax Cou rt of Canada on March 21, 2023. NOTE 17: EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the same method as basic earnings per share except that certain adjustments are made to net income attributable to co mmon shareholders and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares that are ass umed to be issued by the Bank.",

In the ordinary course of business, the Bank and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal and regulat ory actions, including but not limited to civil claims and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits, and requests for information by governmental, regulatory and self -regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions, in respe ct of our businesses and compliance programs. The Bank establishes provisions when it becom es probable that the Bank will incur a loss and the amount can be reliably estimated. The Bank also estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) in its legal and regulatory actions (that is, those which are neither probable nor remote), in exce ss of provisions. As at July 31, 2023, the Bank’s RPL is from zero to approximately $1.29 billion (October 31, 2022 – from zero to approximately $1.26 billion). The Bank’s provisions and RPL represent the Bank’s best estimates based upon currently available information for actions for which estimates can be made, but there are a number of factors that could cause the Bank’s prov isions and/or RPL to be signifi cantly different from its actual or RPL. For example, the Bank’s estimates involve significant judgment due to the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of multiple defendants in many proceedings whose share of liability has yet to be determ ined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, some of which are beyond the Bank’s control and/or involve novel legal theories and interpretations, the attendant uncertainty of the v arious potential outcomes of such proceedings, and the fact that the underlying matters will change from time to time. In addition, some actions seek very large or indeterminate damages. The Bank has been responding to formal and informal inquiries from regulatory authorities and law enforcement concerning its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance program, both generally and in connec tion with specific clients, counterparties or incidents in the US, including in connection with an investiga tion by the United States Department of Justice. The Bank is cooperating with such authorities and is pursuing efforts to enhance its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-m oney laundering compliance program . While the ultimate outcomes of the se inquiries and investigations are unknown at this time, the Bank anticipates monetary and/or non-monetary penalties to be imposed. Stanford Litigation – In the US Ro tstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. act ion, on February 24, 2023, the Bank reached a settlement in principle (the “settlement” or “agreement”) pursuant to which the Bank agreed to pay US$1.205 billion to Ralph S. Janvey, solely in his capacity as the court-appointed receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate, to resolve claims brought by the Official Stanford Investors Committee and the plaintiffs in the Rotstain v. Tr ustmark National Bank, et al. an d Smith v. Independent Bank, et al. actions. As a result of this agreement, the Bank recorded a provision of approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax ($1.2 billion after-tax) in the f irst quarter of 2023. Under the terms of the agreement, all involved parties have agreed to a bar order dismissing and releasing all current or future claims arising from or related to Stanford. On Ma rch 7, 2023, the parties finalized their settlement agreement, and on March 8, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to approve the settlement in the multi district litigation court in the Northern District of Texas. On March 14, 2023, that Court preliminarily found that the terms of the s ettlement agreement are adequate, fair, reasonable, and equitable. On A ugust 8, 2023, the Court granted the plaintiffs ’ motion to approve the settlement and issued the bar order. The bar order and se ttlement approval remain subject to appeal. A case regarding the same facts was also brought in Onta rio by the Joint Liquidators of Stanford International Bank Ltd. appointed by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, under the title McDonald v. The Toronto-Dominion Bank. Tha t action was dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court of Justi ce on June 8, 2021, following a trial earlier in 2021. On November 17, 2022, the Court of Appeal for Ontario issued a unanimous written decision which dismissed the appeal and affirmed the trial decision. On July 20, 2023, the Supreme Court of Canada di smissed an application for leave to appeal by the Joint Liquidators. As a result, the Canadian pr oceeding has now ended. In management’s opinion, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the ultimate disposition of the se actions, individually or in the aggregat e, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or the consolidated cash flows of the Bank. However, because of the factors listed above, as well as other unce rtainties inherent in litigation and regulator y matters, there is a poss ibility that the ultimate resolution of legal or regulat ory actions may be material to the Bank’s consolidated results of operations for any particular reporting period.",
        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report highlights several key financial and legal insights:\n\n1. **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023, both basic and diluted EPS decreased compared to the same periods in 2022. Basic EPS was $1.57 for the three months and $4.12 for the nine months in 2023, down from $1.76 and $5.86, respectively, in 2022. Diluted EPS followed a similar trend.\n\n2. **Stock Options:** The computation of diluted EPS excluded certain stock options due to their exercise prices being higher than the average market price of the bank's shares.\n\n3. **Contingent Liabilities:** The bank is involved in various legal and regulatory actions. As of July 31, 2023, the range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) from these actions is estimated between zero and approximately $1.29 billion.\n\n4. **Stanford Litigation Settlement:** TD Bank reached a settlement in the Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank case, agreeing to pay US$1.205 billion. This resulted in a provision of approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax ($1.2 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023. The settlement has been approved by the court but remains subject to appeal.\n\n5. **Regulatory Inquiries:** The bank is cooperating with regulatory authorities regarding its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering compliance program and anticipates potential penalties.\n\n6. **Legal Proceedings in Canada:** A related case in Ontario was dismissed, and subsequent appeals were denied, concluding the Canadian proceedings.\n\nOverall, while the bank faces significant legal and regulatory challenges, management believes these will not materially affect the bank's consolidated financial condition or cash flows, though they may impact results for specific reporting periods."

        "summary": "The TD Bank Group's third-quarter 2023 report outlines the financial performance across its four main business segments: Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking, with additional activities grouped under the Corporate segment. Key insights include:\n\n1. **Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking**: This segment saw an increase in net interest income and total revenue compared to the previous year, indicating growth in financial products and services offered to personal, small business, and commercial customers.\n\n2. **U.S. Retail**: The segment experienced growth in net interest income, though net income slightly decreased compared to the previous year. This includes personal and business banking, TD Auto Finance U.S., and the U.S. wealth business.\n\n3. **Wealth Management and Insurance**: This segment maintained stable revenue, with a slight decrease in net income, reflecting consistent performance in investment products and insurance services.\n\n4. **Wholesale Banking**: There was a notable increase in total revenue, driven by capital markets and investment banking activities, although net income remained relatively flat.\n\n5. **Corporate Segment**: This segment includes various adjustments and unallocated revenues and expenses, with a significant negative impact on net income, primarily due to asset securitization programs and other corporate-level items.\n\nOverall, the bank's total revenue increased for both the three and nine months ended July 31, 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022. However, net income decreased, influenced by higher provisions for credit losses and increased non-interest expenses. The report also highlights the bank's share of net income from its investment in Schwab, which is reported with a one-month lag."

E 21: REGULATORY CAPITAL The Bank manages its capital under guidelines established by OSF I. The regulatory capital guidelines measure capital in relat ion to credit, market, and operational risks. The Bank ha s various capital policies, procedures, and controls which it utilizes to achieve its goals and objectives. On November 22, 2019, the Bank was designa ted a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). Effe ctive January 1, 2016, OSFI’s target Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios for Canadian banks designated as dom estic systemically important banks (D-SIB s) includes a 1% common equity capital surcharge bringing the targets to 8%, 9 .5%, and 11.5%, respectively. On June 25, 2018, OSFI provided greater transparency related to prev iously undisclosed Pillar 2 CET1 capital buffers through the introduction of th e public Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) which is held by D- SIBs against Pillar 2 risks. The current publi shed buffer is set at 3.0% of total risk-weighted assets (RWA) and must be met with CET1 Capital, effectively raising OSFI ’s published CET1, Tier 1, and To tal Capital minimum target ratios to 11%, 12.5%, and 14.5%, respectively. The OSFI target includes the greater of the D -SIB or G-SIB surcharge, both of which are currently 1%. On Sep tember 23, 2018, the Canadian Bail-in regime came into effect, including OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). Under this guideline, the Bank w as required to meet a supervisory risk-based TLAC target of 24.5% of R WA, inclusive of the 3.0% DSB, and a TLAC leverage ratio target of 6. 75% by November 1, 2021. Changes to the DSB will result in corresponding changes to the risk-based TLAC target ratio. On February 1, 2023, OSFI implemented revised capital rules that incorporate the Basel III reforms with adjustments to mak e them suitable for domestic implementation. These revised rules include revisions to the calculation of credit risk and operational risk requirements, and revisions to the Leverage Requirements Guideline to include a requirement for D-SIBs to hold a leverage ratio buffer of 0.50% in addition to the regulatory minimum requirement of 3.0%. Thi s buffer will also apply to the TLAC leverage ratio supervisory target of 6.75%. On June 20, 2023, OSFI announced that the DSB level will be set at 3.5% as of November 1, 2023. During the nine months ended July 31, 2023, the Bank complied with the OSFI Basel III guidelines related to risk-based and leverage capital ratios.",
