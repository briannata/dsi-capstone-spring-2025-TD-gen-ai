Week 5 Check In (3/25/25) - Feedback for Midterm Report and Presentation
Feedback
The presentation and the report are very clearly organized and presented
Be more broad because the audience is wider (not people from TD bank, etc)
Give more concrete examples for improvements
Concrete metric evaluation for improvement
More demo feel for final presentation, more interesting
Show this is the interface, etc
We could even do screenshots â†’ live demo might be too slow

Final presentation - reserved a different room, May 2, 2025 (hybrid session)
Some affiliates in person and some remote (on zoom)
Enough space and time for all of us to present together if we want to, our choice
4-5 weeks from now until the presentation

Final report
