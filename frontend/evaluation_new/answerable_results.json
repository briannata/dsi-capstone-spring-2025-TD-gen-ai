        "Question": "What is the purpose of the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) established in May 2012?",
        "Expected Answer": "The Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) was established to enhance the risk disclosures of banks and other financial institutions.",
        "Generated Answer": "The Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) was established by the Financial Stability Board in 2012 with the primary purpose of improving banks' risk disclosures. The EDTF aims to enhance transparency and understanding of banks' risk management practices and financial stability by identifying key principles, recommendations, and best practices for risk disclosures. The task force focuses on several critical areas, including:\n\n1. **Risk Governance and Management**: The EDTF emphasizes the importance of presenting risk information cohesively and describing risk management processes. This includes outlining the bank's risk management structure, culture, and stress testing processes, as well as discussing risks arising from business models and activities.\n\n2. **Capital Adequacy**: The task force provides recommendations on disclosing capital requirements, composition, and planning. It also includes analyses of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and compliance with Basel III requirements, ensuring that banks maintain sufficient capital to cover their risks.\n\n3. **Liquidity and Funding**: The EDTF highlights the need for transparency in liquidity management, asset encumbrance, and funding strategies. This includes providing a breakdown of assets and liabilities by maturity to assess the bank's ability to meet its financial obligations.\n\n4. **Market and Credit Risk**: The task force recommends linking market risk measures to portfolios and detailing credit risk profiles, including impaired loans and counterparty risks. It also emphasizes the importance of discussing risk mitigation strategies.\n\n5. **Other Risks**: The EDTF encourages banks to describe additional risk types and publicly known risk events, emphasizing the bank's approach to identifying, governing, and managing these risks.\n\nOverall, the EDTF's purpose is to ensure that banks provide comprehensive and transparent risk disclosures, enabling stakeholders to better understand the risks faced by banks and their strategies for managing these risks. This, in turn, contributes to the stability and resilience of the financial system.",

        "Question": "What is the range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) for legal and regulatory actions as of April 30, 2023?",
        "Expected Answer": "The Bank's RPL as of April 30, 2023, is from zero to approximately $1.27 billion.",
        "Generated Answer": "As of April 30, 2023, TD Bank Group's range of reasonably possible losses (RPL) for legal and regulatory actions was estimated to be between zero and approximately $1.25 billion. This estimation reflects the bank's involvement in various legal and regulatory actions, including significant developments such as the settlement in the Stanford Litigation, where TD Bank agreed to pay $1.205 billion, subject to court approval. Despite these legal challenges, the bank's management believes that these actions will not materially affect its consolidated financial condition or cash flows, although they may impact results for specific reporting periods. This information is derived from the 2023 Q1 report, which provides insights into the bank's contingent liabilities and segmented financial reporting for that period.",

        "Question": "What is the business model for debt securities and loans that pass the SPPI test when held within a 'held-to-collect' business model?",
        "Expected Answer": "Debt securities and loans that pass the SPPI test when held within a 'held-to-collect' business model are measured at amortized cost.",
        "Generated Answer": "Debt securities and loans that pass the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) test and are held within a 'held-to-collect' business model are measured at amortized cost. This classification is based on the business model assessment under IFRS 9, which determines how financial assets are managed and their cash flow characteristics.\n\n### Key Characteristics of the 'Held-to-Collect' Business Model:\n\n1. **Objective**: The primary objective of the 'held-to-collect' business model is to collect contractual cash flows from the financial assets. This means that the bank intends to hold these assets until maturity to receive the principal and interest payments.\n\n2. **Measurement**: Financial assets in this category are measured at amortized cost. This involves recognizing the asset on the balance sheet at its initial cost, adjusted for any principal repayments, amortization, and impairment losses.\n\n3. **Interest Income Recognition**: Interest income from these assets is recognized using the Effective Interest Rate Method (EIRM). This method calculates the interest income by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset.\n\n4. **Credit Losses**: The measurement at amortized cost is adjusted for expected credit losses (ECLs). The ECL model is used to estimate potential credit losses over the life of the asset, considering changes in credit risk.\n\n5. **Financial Metrics**: While specific financial metrics and figures are not provided in the context, the general approach involves using metrics like Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD) to calculate ECLs. These metrics help in assessing the credit risk and potential losses associated with the financial assets.\n\nOverall, the 'held-to-collect' business model focuses on the collection of cash flows through holding the assets to maturity, with a strong emphasis on managing credit risk and recognizing interest income effectively.",
